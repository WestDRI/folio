Chapel is a modern programming language designed for both shared and distributed memory systems, offering
high-level, easy-to-use abstractions for task and data parallelism. Its intuitive syntax makes it an excellent
choice for novice HPC users learning parallel programming. Chapel supports a wide range of parallel hardware
-- from multicore processors and multi-node clusters to GPUs -- using consistent syntax and concepts across
all levels of hardware parallelism.

Chapel dramatically reduces the complexity of parallel coding by combining the simplicity of Python-style
programming with the performance of compiled languages like C and Fortran. Parallel operations that might
require dozens of lines in MPI can often be written in just a few lines of Chapel. As an open-source language,
it runs on most Unix-like operating systems and scales from laptops to large HPC systems.

This course begins with Chapel fundamentals, then focuses on data parallelism through two numerical examples:
one embarrassingly parallel and one tightly coupled. We'll also briefly explore task parallelism (a more
complex topic, and not the primary focus in this course). Finally, we'll introduce GPU programming with
Chapel.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (SFU)

**Prerequisites:** basic understanding of HPC at the introductory level (how to submit jobs with Slurm scheduler) and
  basic knowledge of the Linux command line.

**Software**: For the hands-on, we will use Chapel on our training cluster. To access the training cluster, you will
need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers SSH is
usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there). We will provide guest accounts to all
participants. No need to install Chapel on your computer.
