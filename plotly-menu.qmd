**Abstract**: Plotly is an open-source visualization library for creating interactive, publication-quality
graphs in Python (and other languages), with support for a wide range of plot types. In this workshop, you
will learn two ways to use Plotly: the high-level Plotly Express interface for rapid data exploration, and the
more flexible Plotly Graph Objects interface for detailed customization. We will explore common plot types --
line, scatter, bar, pie, and heatmap -- as well as more advanced and 3D visualizations. You will learn how to
display figures using different rendering backends, save them as image or HTML files, and view them inside
Jupyter notebooks. Finally, we will take a look at Plotly Dash, a framework for building interactive data web
applications with sliders, buttons, dropdown menus and other interactive elements.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (SFU)

**Prerequisites**: Some knowledge of Python.
