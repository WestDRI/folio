    "#### Abstract\n",
    "Matplotlib is the foundational plotting library for Python, and is widely used in tandem with other scientific libraries (such as NumPy and Pandas) to visualize data across many different fields. It is a free and open source software library that offers fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot, making it a powerful tool for customizing figures to meet specific needs. In this workshop, we will use a Jupyter notebook to show you how to create common 2D plot types such as line, scatter, and heatmaps, and how to customize the labels, legend, and panel layout. We will briefly touch on using Matplotlib to produce animations and interactive visualizations. By the end of this one-hours session, you will have a basic understanding of the library’s capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to follow?\n",
    "Notebook link: https://pages.scinet.utoronto.ca/~ymeiron/matplotlib-demo.ipynb\n",
    "* I'm using SciNet [Open OnDemand](https://ondemand.scinet.utoronto.ca) JupyterLab. Use that if you have access to the Trillium system.\n",
    "* If you don't, you can install the `notebook`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `ipympl` Python packages and the `ffmpeg` software *locally*, and launch a notebook server.\n",
    "* You can use a free (or paid) cloud Jupyter notebook environment (Google Colab, Binder, Kaggle). Note that not all support interactive plots.\n",
    "* We have a Magic Castle instance for this lecture (details provided separately). This *does not* support interactive plots however.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib (MPL) is a plotting library for Python, launched in 2003 and inspired by MATLAB. Today we are going to learn the basics of working with it, and I'm going to demo a few common types of plots, but what we can show in an hour is really the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible. The best way to learn further is to go to the [gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) and find a figure with features you are interested in, and look at the source code to learn how it was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPL provides a high level API (object-oriented as well as state-based) for creating figures, using several possible backends. This API is called PyPlot, let's import it and draw our first figure."

   "source": [
    "The `subplots` function, called with no parameters here, caused this image to be added to our notebook and returned `Figure` and `Axes` objects. The figure is the top level container for all the plot elements. Each visible element, or an object that can draw itself on a figure, is called an *artist* in MPL terminology (the figure itself is also technically an artist). The axes object (or *subfigure*) is an artist contained in the figure, and it itself contains other artists (such as the ticks and labels, and plot elements once we add them). Artists have member functions that we can use to manipulate them, as we shall see. Axes are optional but in this lecture we'll always use them, and we can have more than one set of axes in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: LightSkyBlue\">🛈</span> This is not the only way to create a figure with axes. In fact, there are usually multiple ways to do anything in Matplotlib, in violation of [the Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python). Here we'll stick to an object-oriented coding style and avoid shortcuts. This will produce a code that is slightly longer, but more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backends\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the figure appearing in the notebook. While this was just one line, obviously there is a lot of low level *backend* code that's involved here. MPL can use several different backends to actually create an image (be it static or interactive). We don't need to know much about what they do and how, but just that we have the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The default backend in Jupyter notebooks is called `inline`. It essentially creates a PNG image (a static bitmap) from the figure, that is embedded into the notebook web page. Here, we cannot interact with the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative backend for Jupyter Notebooks is `ipympl` (requires a package of the same name to be installed). It renders the figure as an applet using web technologies (such as JavaScript) that get embedded in the notebook web page. Here, we can interact with the figure using the mouse as we are going to see. To switch to this backend use the `%matplotlib ipympl` Jupyter \"magic\" command.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: LightSkyBlue\">🛈</span> In a notebook, if we create a figure in one cell, the `Figure` object still exists in the following cells (until it's discarded, e.g. the `fig` name reassigned). If it (or subordinate artists) is manipulated in the following cells, this will only affect what we see embedded in the notebook if we are using the `ipympl` backend. If the `inline` backend is used, commands run in the following cells won't affect the already-displayed figure. In this case you can draw the figure again using `display(fig)`."

    "#### Interactive backends and the `show` function\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Python code runs as a standalone program through the command line, you'll usually use a backend that renders the figure in a graphical window. The backend will normally be chosen automatically based on the operating system and Python/MPL installation, but can be changed using the `matplotlib.use` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importantly**, when all figures are ready, use `plt.show()` to indicate to the backend to open the graphical windows (one per figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static backends and the `savefig` function\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Python code runs in a non-interactive environment, such as when running a batch job in an HPC cluster, you'll use a *static* backend, that will not attempt to render anything to the screen. In most cases the library will know that there is no display available, but if MPL is trying to use an interactive backend for some reason and is producing an error, you can change it by using the `matplotlib.use` function (and choosing a static backend such as `agg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In those cases, you will save a figure to a file. The static backend will be chosen automatically based on the file extension. For example:"
