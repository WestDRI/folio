    "text": "GPU efficiency on NVIDIA’s H100 cards\nThese GPUs can be challenging to utilize effectively: most off-the-shelf software packages achieve well below 75% utilization on a full GPU. I plan to use a simple Chapel code to demonstrate profiling steps. The challenge is that my current code is too efficient, maintaining 100% GPU usage. I’ve manually degraded its efficiency for demonstration purposes, but I’d prefer to start with a less efficient version and then optimize it, so perhaps I need to consider a different numerical problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionNumerical problem\n\n\n\n Prime factorization of an integer number is finding all its prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 60 are 2, 2, 3, and 5. Let’s write a function that takes an integer number and returns the sum of all its prime factors. For example, for 60 it will return 2+2+3+5 = 12, for 91 it will return 7+13 = 20, for 101 it will return 101, and so on.    Since 1 has no prime factors, we start computing from 2, and then apply this function to all integers in the range 2..n, where n is a larger number. We will do all computations separately from scratch for each number, i.e. we will not cache our results (caching can significantly speed up our calculations but the point here is to focus on brute-force computing). \n\n\nHere is the GPU version of the code primesGPU.chpl (the CPU version is very similar, with obvious simplifications):\nuse Time;\nvar watch: stopwatch;\n\nproc primeFactorizationSum(n: int) {\n  var num = n, total = 0, count = 0;\n  while num % 2 == 0 {\n    num /= 2;\n    count += 1;\n  }\n  for j in 1..count do total += 2;\n  for i in 3..(sqrt(n:real)):int by 2 {\n    count = 0;\n    while num % i == 0 {\n      num /= i;\n      count += 1;\n    }\n    for j in 1..count do total += i;\n  }\n  if num &gt; 2 then total += num;\n  return total;\n}\n\nconfig const a = 2, n = 10;\non here.gpus[0] {\n  var A: [a..n] int;\n  watch.start();\n  @assertOnGpu foreach i in a..n do\n    A[i] = primeFactorizationSum(i);\n  watch.stop(); writeln('It took ', watch.elapsed(), ' seconds');\n  var lastFewDigits = if n &gt; 5 then n-4..n else a..n;   // last 5 or fewer digits\n  writeln(\"A = \", A[lastFewDigits]);\n}\nRunning it on a full H100 card on the cluster:\nmodule load gcc/12.3 cuda/12.2 chapel-ucx-cuda/2.4.0\nchpl --fast primesGPU.chpl\nsalloc --time=... --mem-per-cpu=3600 --gpus-per-node=h100:1 --account=...\n./primesGPU -nl 1 --n=1_000_000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\nsingle-core CPU time in sec\nGPU time in sec\nspeedup factor\nGPU memory in MiB\n\n\n\n\n1e6\n0.5330\n0.000717\n743\n\n\n\n10e6\n16.49\n0.017904\n921\n\n\n\n100e6\n516.8\n0.5456\n947\n\n\n\n1e9\n\n16.91\n\n\n\n\n2e9\n\n48.10\n\n\n\n\n3e9\n\n88.31\n\n\n\n\n5e9\n\n270.8\n\n38670\n\n\n10e9\n\n1357\n\n76816\n\n\n\nRunning nvidia-smi on the GPU node, we see GPU utilization at 100%, and power consumption of 263W / 316W/ 318W / 267W (different stages of the same job) out of max 700W.\n\nMoving some of the calculations to the host\nDivide the entire range 2..n into 100 groups. Next, divide each group into 10 items (each still being a range), of which the first 9 items are processed on the GPU, and the last one on the CPU in serial – a nice demo of Amdahl’s Law.\nuse Time;\nimport RangeChunk.chunks;\nvar watch: stopwatch;\n\nproc primeFactorizationSum(n: int) {\n  var num = n, total = 0, count = 0;\n  while num % 2 == 0 {\n    num /= 2;\n    count += 1;\n  }\n  for j in 1..count do total += 2;\n  for i in 3..(sqrt(n:real)):int by 2 {\n    count = 0;\n    while num % i == 0 {\n      num /= i;\n      count += 1;\n    }\n    for j in 1..count do total += i;\n  }\n  if num &gt; 2 then total += num;\n  return total;\n}\n\nconfig const a = 2, n = 5_000_000_000;\non here.gpus[0] {\n  var A: [a..n] int;\n  watch.start();\n  for group in chunks(a..n, 100) {\n    for item in chunks(group, 10) {\n      if item.last &lt; group.last then\n        @assertOnGpu foreach i in item do   // first 9 items in each group are processed on the GPU\n          A[i] = primeFactorizationSum(i);\n      else\n        for i in item do                    // last item in each group is processed on the CPU\n          A[i] = primeFactorizationSum(i);\n    }\n  }\n  watch.stop(); writeln('It took ', watch.elapsed(), ' seconds');\n  var lastFewDigits = if n &gt; 5 then n-4..n else a..n;   // last 5 or fewer digits\n  writeln(\"A = \", A[lastFewDigits]);\n}\n\n\n\nOn a full H100, this runs at 10% GPU efficiency, consuming 112W out of max 700W.\nIn the actual workshop, in addition to nvidia-smi, I am hoping to use NVIDIA’s Nsight profilers (if those can work with Chapel-compiled binaries) and our cluster’s monitoring portal (not yet in production). Combine this with MIG partitions and MPS scheduling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do I go in the opposite direction, starting from an inefficient code? Need a simple numerical problem for which a naive implementation results in a poorly-performing GPU code which would be simple to improve. Here are a couple of things to try:\n1. the 3D version of the acoustic wave solver should run inefficiently for smaller problems on a GPU\n2. 2D acoustic wave solver for very large problems\n3. a Julia set should suffer from load imbalance, but not sure if it’ll show when running on a GPU"

We can do this directly without initializing an xarray.DataArray first – we just need to specify what this temperature variable depends on:\nimport xarray as xr\nimport numpy as np\nntime = len(time)\ntemp = 10 + 5*np.sin((250+np.arange(ntime))/365.25*2*np.pi) + 2*np.random.randn(ntime)\nds = xr.Dataset({ \"temperature\": (\"time\", temp),        # it's 1D function of time\n                  \"time\": time })\nds.temperature.plot(size=8)\nWe can do the usual subsetting:\nds.isel(time=100)   # 101st timestep\nds.sel(time=\"2002-12-22\")\nTime dependency in xarray allows resampling with a different timestep:\nds.resample(time='7D')                   # 1096 times -&gt; 157 time groups\nweekly = ds.resample(time='7D').mean()   # compute mean for each group\nweekly.dims\nweekly.temperature.plot(size=8)\nNow, let’s combine spatial and time dependency and construct a dataset containing two 2D variables (temperature and pressure) varying in time. The time dependency is baked into the coordinates of these xarray.DataArray’s and should come before the spatial coordinates:\ntime = pd.date_range(\"2020-01-01\", freq=\"D\", periods=91) # January - March 2020\nntime = len(time)\nn = 100      # spatial resolution in each dimension\naxis = np.linspace(0,1,n)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(axis,axis)   # 2D Cartesian meshes of x,y coordinates\ninitialState = (1-Y)*np.sin(np.pi*X) + Y*(np.sin(2*np.pi*X))**2\nfinalState =   (1-X)*np.sin(np.pi*Y) + X*(np.sin(2*np.pi*Y))**2\nf = np.zeros((ntime,n,n))\nfor t in range(ntime):\n    z = (t+0.5) / ntime   # dimensionless time from 0 to 1\n    f[t,:,:] = (1-z)*initialState + z*finalState\n\ncoords = {\"time\": time, \"x\": axis, \"y\": axis}\ntemp = xr.DataArray(\n    20 + f,       # this 2D array varies in time from initialState to finalState\n    dims=(\"time\",\"y\",\"x\"),\n    coords=coords\n)\npres = xr.DataArray(   # random 2D array\n    100 + 10*np.random.randn(ntime,n,n),\n    dims=(\"time\",\"y\",\"x\"),\n    coords=coords\n)\nds = xr.Dataset({\"temperature\": temp, \"pressure\": pres})\nds.sel(time=\"2020-03-15\").temperature.plot(size=8)   # temperature distribution on a specific date\nds.to_netcdf(\"evolution.nc\")\nThe file evolution.nc should be 100^2 x 2 variables x 8 bytes x 91 steps = 14MB. We can load it into ParaView and play back the pressure and temperature!",

There are many ways; perhaps, the easiest is by defining columns:\ncol1 = [1,2,3]\ncol2 = [4,5,6]\npd.DataFrame({'a': col1, 'b': col2})       # dataframe from a dictionary\nWe can index (assign names to) the rows with this syntax:\npd.DataFrame({'a': col1, 'b': col2}, index=['a1','a2','a3'])\n\n\n\nLet’s try reading some public-domain data about Jeopardy questions with pandas (31MB file, so it might take a while):\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razoumov/publish/master/jeopardy.csv\")\ndata.shape      # 216930 rows, 7 columns\ndata.head(10)   # first 10 rows\ndata.tail()     # last 5 rows\ndata.iloc[2:5]  # rows 2-4\ndata.columns    # names of the columns\n\ndata['Category']\ndata['Category']=='HISTORY'\ndata.loc[data['Category']=='HISTORY'].shape   # 349 matches\ndata.loc[data['Category']=='HISTORY'].to_csv(\"history.csv\")   # write to a file\nLet’s check what time period is covered by these data:\ndata[\"Air Date\"]\ndata[\"Air Date\"][0][-2:]   # first row, last two digits is the year\nyear = data[\"Air Date\"].apply(lambda x: x[-2:])   # last two digits of the year from all rows\nyear.min(); year.max()     # '00' and '99' - not very informative, wraps at the turn of the century\n\nfor y in range(100):\n    twoDigits = str(y).zfill(2)\n    print(twoDigits, sum(year==twoDigits))\nThis shows that this table covers years from 1984 to 2012.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will see that there are different techniques to process a Pandas dataframe, and some of them are more efficient than others. However, first we need to learn how to time execution of a block of Python code:\n\nInside a Jupyter notebook, you can use %%timeit to time an entire cell.\nInside your code, you can call time.time() function:\n\nimport time\nstart = time.time()\n...\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nNow, let’s go to our computational problem. “Fizz buzz” is a children’s game to practice divisions. Players take turn counting out loud while replacing: - any number divisible by 3 with the word “Fizz”, - any number divisible by 5 with the word “Buzz”, - any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word “FizzBuzz”.\nLet’s implement this in pandas! First, create a simple dataframe from scratch:\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\nsize = 10_000\ndf['number'] = np.arange(1, size+1)\nDefine for pretty printing:\ndef show(frame):\n    print(df.tail(15).to_string(index=False))   # print last 15 rows without the row index\n\nshow(df)\nLet’s built a new column response containing either “Fizz” or “Buzz” or “FizzBuzz” or the original number, based on the number value in that row. We start by processing a row:\ndef count(row):\n    if (row['number'] % 3 == 0) and (row['number'] % 5 == 0):\n        return 'FizzBuzz'\n    elif row['number'] % 3 == 0:\n        return 'Fizz'\n    elif row['number'] % 5 == 0:\n      return 'Buzz'\n    else:\n      return str(row['number'])\nHere is how you would use this function:\nprint(df.iloc[2])\nprint(count(df.iloc[2]))\n\nWe can apply this function to each row in a loop:\n\n%%timeit\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    df.loc[index, 'response'] = count(row)\n413 ms ± 11.1 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\nshow(df)\n\nWe can use df.apply() to apply this function to each row:\n\n%%timeit\ndf['response'] = df.apply(count, axis=1)\n69.1 ms ± 380 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\nshow(df)\n\nOr we could use a mask to only assign correct responses to the corresponding rows:\n\n%%timeit\ndf['response'] = df['number'].astype(str)\ndf.loc[df['number'] % 3==0, 'response'] = 'Fizz'\ndf.loc[df['number'] % 5==0, 'response'] = 'Buzz'\ndf.loc[(df['number'] % 3==0) & (df['number'] % 5==0), 'response'] = 'FizzBuzz'\n718 µs ± 10.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\nshow(df)\n\n\n\nLet’s say we want to read several files in data-python/. We can use for to loop through their list:\nfor name in ['africa.csv', 'asia.csv']:\n    data = pd.read_csv('data-python/gapminder_gdp_'+name, index_col='country')\n    print(name+'\\n', data.min(), sep='')   # print min for each column\nIf we have many (10s or 100s) files, we want to specify them with a pattern:\nfrom glob import glob\nprint('all csv files in data-python:', glob('data-python/*.csv'))    # returns a list\nprint('all text files in data-python:', glob('data-python/*.txt'))   # empty list\nlist = glob('data-python/*.csv')\nlen(list)\nfor filename in glob('data-python/gapminder*.csv'):\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n    print(filename, data.gdpPercap_1952.min())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 13.10\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these files is not matched by the expression glob('data-python/*as*.csv')?\nA. data-python/gapminder_gdp_africa.csv\nB. data-python/gapminder_gdp_americas.csv\nC. data-python/gapminder_gdp_asia.csv\nD. 1 and 2 are not matched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 13.11\n\n\n\n\n\nModify this program so that it prints the number of records in the file that has the fewest records.\nfewest = ____\nfor filename in glob('data-python/*.csv'):\n    fewest = ____\nprint('smallest file has', fewest, 'records')",

Let’s index by country:\ndata = pd.read_csv('data-python/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv', index_col='country')\ndata\ndata.shape        # now 12 columns\ndata.info()       # it's a dataframe! show row/column names, precision, memory usage\nprint(data.columns)   # list all the columns\nprint(data.T)     # this will transpose the dataframe; curously this is a variable\ndata.describe()   # will print some statistics of numerical columns (very useful for 1000s of rows!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuick question\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would you list all country names?\nHint: try data.T.columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 13.3\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the data in gapminder_gdp_americas.csv (which should be in the same directory as gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv) into a variable called americas and display its summary statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 13.4\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a command to display the first three rows of the americas data frame. What about the last three columns of this data frame?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 13.5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for your current project is stored in a file called microbes.csv, which is located in a folder called field_data. You are doing analysis in a notebook called analysis.ipynb in a sibling folder called thesis:\nyour_home_directory\n├── fieldData\n│   └── microbes.csv\n└── thesis\n    └── analysis.ipynb\nWhat value(s) should you pass to read_csv() to read microbes.csv in analysis.ipynb?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 13.6\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as the pd.read_csv() function for reading data from a file, Pandas provides a to_csv() function to write data frames to files. Applying what you’ve learned about reading from files, write one of your data frames to a file called processed.csv. You can use help to get information on how to use to_csv().",

There are many ways; perhaps, the easiest is by defining columns:\ncol1 = [1,2,3]\ncol2 = [4,5,6]\npd.DataFrame({'a': col1, 'b': col2})       # dataframe from a dictionary\nWe can index (assign names to) the rows with this syntax:\npd.DataFrame({'a': col1, 'b': col2}, index=['a1','a2','a3'])",

However, first we need to learn how to time execution of a block of Python code:\n\nInside a Jupyter notebook, you can use %%timeit to time an entire cell.\nInside your code, you can call time.time() function:\n\nimport time\nstart = time.time()\n...\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nNow, let’s go to our computational problem. “Fizz buzz” is a children’s game to practice divisions. Players take turn counting out loud while replacing: - any number divisible by 3 with the word “Fizz”, - any number divisible by 5 with the word “Buzz”, - any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word “FizzBuzz”.\nLet’s implement this in pandas! First, create a simple dataframe from scratch:\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\nsize = 10_000\ndf['number'] = np.arange(1, size+1)\nDefine for pretty printing:\ndef show(frame):\n    print(df.tail(15).to_string(index=False))   # print last 15 rows without the row index\n\nshow(df)\nLet’s built a new column response containing either “Fizz” or “Buzz” or “FizzBuzz” or the original number, based on the number value in that row. We start by processing a row:\ndef count(row):\n    if (row['number'] % 3 == 0) and (row['number'] % 5 == 0):\n        return 'FizzBuzz'\n    elif row['number'] % 3 == 0:\n        return 'Fizz'\n    elif row['number'] % 5 == 0:\n      return 'Buzz'\n    else:\n      return str(row['number'])\nHere is how you would use this function:\nprint(df.iloc[2])\nprint(count(df.iloc[2]))\n\nWe can apply this function to each row in a loop:\n\n%%timeit\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    df.loc[index, 'response'] = count(row)\n413 ms ± 11.1 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\nshow(df)\n\nWe can use df.apply() to apply this function to each row:\n\n%%timeit\ndf['response'] = df.apply(count, axis=1)\n69.1 ms ± 380 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\nshow(df)\n\nOr we could use a mask to only assign correct responses to the corresponding rows:\n\n%%timeit\ndf['response'] = df['number'].astype(str)\ndf.loc[df['number'] % 3==0, 'response'] = 'Fizz'\ndf.loc[df['number'] % 5==0, 'response'] = 'Buzz'\ndf.loc[(df['number'] % 3==0) & (df['number'] % 5==0), 'response'] = 'FizzBuzz'\n718 µs ± 10.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\nshow(df)",

Note that matplotlib automatically adjusts the axis ranges to fit both plots:\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nfrom numpy import linspace, sin\nx = linspace(0.01,1,300)\ny = sin(1/x)\nplt.plot(x, y, 'bo-', label='one')\nplt.plot(x+0.3, 2*sin(10*x), 'r-', label='two')\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.xlabel('x', fontsize=18)\nplt.ylabel('f(x)', fontsize=18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s plot these two functions side-by-side:\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))\nfrom numpy import linspace, sin\nx = linspace(0.01,1,300)\ny = sin(1/x)\n\nax = fig.add_subplot(121)   # on 1x2 layout create plot #1 (`axes` object with some data space)\nplt.plot(x, y, 'bo-', label='one')\nax.set_ylim(-1.5, 1.5)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f1')\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\n\nfig.add_subplot(122)   # on 1x2 layout create plot #2\nplt.plot(x+0.2, 2*sin(10*x), 'r-', label='two')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f2')\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nThere is also an option to specify absolute coordinates of each plot with fig.add_axes():\n\nreplace the first ax = fig.add_subplot(121) with ax = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.3])   # left, bottom, width, height\nreplace the second fig.add_subplot(122) with fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.4])   # left, bottom, width, height\n\nThe 3rd option for more fine-grained control is plt.axes() – it creates an axes object (a region of the figure with some data space). These two lines are equivalent - both create a new figure with one subplot:\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8)); ax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8)); ax = plt.axes()\nShortly we will see that we can pass additional flags to fig.add_subplot() and plt.axes() for more coordinate system control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 12.1\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak the plot into two subplots, the fist taking 1/3 of the space on the left, the second one 2/3 of the space on the right.\n\n\n\nLet’s plot a simple line in the x-y plane:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nx = np.linspace(0,1,100)\nplt.plot(2*np.pi*x, x, 'b-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f1')\nReplace ax = fig.add_subplot(111) with ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='polar'). Now we have a plot in the phi-r plane, i.e. in polar coordinates. Phi goes [0,2\\(\\pi\\)], whereas r goes [0,1].\n?fig.add_subplot    # look into `projection` parameter\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='mollweide')\nlon = np.radians(np.linspace(30,90,10))\nlat = np.radians(np.linspace(15,18,10))\nplt.plot(lon, lat, 'go-')\nYou can use this projection parameter together with cartopy package to process 2D geospatial data to produce maps, while all plotting is still being done by Matplotlib. We teach cartopy in a separate workshop.\nLet’s try a scatter plot:\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nx = np.random.random(size=1000)   # 1D array of 1000 random numbers in [0,1]\ny = np.random.random(size=1000)\nsize = 1 + 50*np.random.random(size=1000)\nplt.scatter(x, y, s=size, color='lightblue')\nFor other plot types, click on any example in the Matplotlib gallery.\nFor colours, see Choosing Colormaps in Matplotlib.",

In this workshop we focus on writing and running scripts and functions in Bash. Scripts are great for simplifying and automating your workflows on any computer with Bash installed, whether it is your own laptop or a remote HPC cluster (where the command line is often the only available interface). You don’t need to know Bash to attend this workshop, as we will start from the basics and will slowly build up our skills using many hands-on examples.\nSoftware: If you want to follow along the hands-on part of this workshop, you will need a terminal emulator. Linux and MacOS probably already have one, and Windows users can install the free version of MobaXterm (see https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html for installation) to connect to our remote server. With MobaXterm you can also run a local terminal emulator, but we are not sure about the set of bash commands available there, so with Windows we highly recommend connecting to our system (we will provide guest accounts)."

    "text": "Combining find and grep\n\nLet’s say you want to run a command on each of the files in the output of find. You can always do something using command substitution like this:\n$ for f in $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\n&gt; do\n&gt;   command on $f\n&gt; done\nAlternatively, you can make it a one-liner:\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -exec command {} \\;       # important to have spaces\nAnother – perhaps more elegant – one-line alternative is to use xargs. In its simplest usage, xargs command lets you construct a list of arguments:\n\nfind . -name \"*.txt\"                   # returns multiple lines\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" | xargs           # use those lines to construct a list\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" | xargs command   # pass this list as arguments to `command`\ncommand $(find . -name \"*.txt\")        # command substitution, achieving the same result (this is riskier!)\ncommand `(find . -name \"*.txt\")`       # alternative syntax for command substitution\nIn these examples, xargs achieves the same result as command substitution, but it is safer in terms of memory usage and the length of lists you can pass.\nWhere would you use this? Well, consider grep command that takes a search stream (and not a list of files) as its standard input:\ncat filename | grep pattern\nTo pass a list of files to grep, you can use xargs that takes that list from its standard input and converts it into a list of arguments that is then passed to grep:\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" | xargs grep pattern   # search for `pattern` inside all those files (`grep` does not take a list of files as standard input)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Recursive search\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a one-line command that will search for a string in all files in the current directory and all its subdirectories, and will hide errors (e.g. due to permissions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Command substitution\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with command substitution using both $(...) and `...` syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can watch a video for this topic after the workshop.",

First, let’s apply our knowledge of grep to this text:\n$ cd /path/to/data-shell\n$ ls   # shows wellsInvisibleMan.txt\n$ wc wellsInvisibleMan.txt                          # number of lines, words, characters\n$ grep invisible wellsInvisibleMan.txt              # see the invisible man\n$ grep invisible wellsInvisibleMan.txt | wc -l      # returns 60; adding -w gives the same count\n$ grep -i invisible wellsInvisibleMan.txt | wc -l   # returns 176 (includes: invisible Invisible INVISIBLE)\nLet’s sidetrack for a second and see how we can use the “stream editor” sed:\n$ sed 's/[iI]nvisible/visible/g' wellsInvisibleMan.txt &gt; visible.txt   # make him visible\n$ cat wellsInvisibleMan.txt | sed 's/[iI]nvisible/visible/g' &gt; visible.txt   # this also works (standard input)\n$ grep -i invisible visible.txt   # see what was not converted\n$ man sed\nNow let’s remove punctuation from the original file using “tr” (translate) command:\n$ cat wellsInvisibleMan.txt | tr -d \"[:punct:]\" &gt; nopunct.txt    # tr only takes standard input\n$ tail wellsInvisibleMan.txt\n$ tail nopunct.txt\nNext, convert all upper case to lower case:\n$ cat nopunct.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' &gt; lower.txt\n$ tail lower.txt\nNext, replace spaces with new lines:\n$ cat lower.txt | sed 's/ /\\'$'\\n/g' &gt; words.txt   # \\'$'\\n is a shortcut for a new line\n$ more words.txt\nNext, remove empty lines:\n$ sed '/^$/d' words.txt  &gt; compact.txt\nNext, sort the list alphabetically, count each word’s occurrence, and remove duplicate words:\n$ cat compact.txt | sort | uniq -c &gt; dictionary.txt\n$ more dictionary.txt\nNext, sort the list into most frequent words:\n$ cat dictionary.txt | sort -gr &gt; frequency.txt   # use 'man sort'\n$ more frequency.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can watch a video for this topic after the workshop.\n\n\nQuick reference:\nsed 's/pattern1/pattern2/' filename    # replace pattern1 with pattern2, one per line\nsed 's/pattern1/pattern2/g' filename   # same but multiple per line\nsed 's|pattern1|pattern2|g' filename   # same\n\ncat wellsInvisibleMan.txt | tr -d \"[:punct:]\" &gt; nopunct.txt # remove punctuation; tr only takes standard input\ncat nopunct.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' &gt; lower.txt    # convert all upper case to lower case\ncat lower.txt | sed 's/ /\\'$'\\n/g' &gt; words.txt              # replace spaces with new lines\nsed '/^$/d' words.txt  &gt; compact.txt                # remove empty lines\ncat compact.txt | sort | uniq -c &gt; dictionary.txt   # sort the list alphabetically, count each word's occurrence\ncat dictionary.txt | sort -gr &gt; frequency.txt       # sort the list into most frequent words\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 10.1\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you shorten our novel-manipulation workflow putting it into a single line using pipes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 10.2\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script that takes an English-language text file and prints the list of its 100 most common words, along with the word count in its dictionary.

Le matériel de formation sera ajouté à cette page après chaque session.\nVous pouvez vous inscrire ici – veuillez sélectionner tous les ateliers auxquels vous voulez participer.\nCliquez sur chaque séance pour plus de détails et pour le lien calendrier.\n\n\nJan-20, 10am PT – Intro session: which tool is right for me? (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: This overview session introduces all workshops in the Series and provides high-level answers to questions such as:\n\nWhat are the differences among Python plotting libraries – Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Vega-Altair, and Plotnine – and when should you choose one over another?\nWhy use ParaView for 3D scientific visualization, and what are its core capabilities?\nIn what ways can you use Python scripting in ParaView? (There is more than one!)\nWhat are the three primary approaches to creating animations in ParaView?\nWhat is in-situ visualization?\nAny domain-specific visualization tools covered in this Series?\nWhich scientific web visualization tools should you consider using in 2026?\n\nWe will also briefly cover tools not included in this Series, such as VisIt, Python mapping packages, Julia plotting libraries, and others, and explain why they were left out.\nPDF slides\n\n\n\n\nJan-20, 11am PT – Plotting in Python with Matplotlib (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Yohai Meiron (Univ. of Toronto)\nAbstract: Matplotlib is the foundational plotting library for Python, and is widely used in tandem with other scientific libraries (such as NumPy and Pandas) to visualize data across many different fields. It is a free and open source software library that offers fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot, making it a powerful tool for customizing figures to meet specific needs. In this workshop, we will use a Jupyter notebook to show you how to create common 2D plot types such as line, scatter, and heatmaps, and how to customize the labels, legend, and panel layout. We will briefly touch on using Matplotlib to produce animations and interactive visualizations. By the end of this one-hours session, you will have a basic understanding of the library’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPython notebook (external link)   Notebook in PDF format\n\n\n\n\nJan-27, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Seaborn (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Jarno van der Kolk (Univ. of Ottawa)\nAbstract: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics and is particularly well suited for displaying multi-dimensional data to get quick insight in a dataset.\nPrerequisites: Some knowledge of Python.\nPython notebook (external GitHub repo)   Notebook in PDF format\n\n\n\n\nJan-30, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Plotly (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: Plotly is an open-source visualization library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs in Python (and other languages), with support for a wide range of plot types. In this workshop, you will learn two ways to use Plotly: the high-level Plotly Express interface for rapid data exploration, and the more flexible Plotly Graph Objects interface for detailed customization. We will explore common plot types – line, scatter, bar, pie, and heatmap – as well as more advanced and 3D visualizations. You will learn how to display figures using different rendering backends, save them as image or HTML files, and view them inside Jupyter notebooks. Finally, we will take a look at Plotly Dash, a framework for building interactive data web applications with sliders, buttons, dropdown menus and other interactive elements.\nPrerequisites: Some knowledge of Python.\nOnline notes\n\n\n\n\nFeb-03, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Vega-Altair (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: How can you uncover the hidden trends in your thousands of data rows? This workshop teaches you how to create interactive charts from your tabular data. You’ll master histograms, time series plots, distributions, and multi-faceted graphs to transform your tables into impactful visualizations.\nOutline:\n\nCreating interactive charts with Altair\nBuilding a figure step-by-step using a grammar of graphics\nVisualizing time series and data distributions\nCreating multiple facets in a single figure\n\nSlides   GitHub repository\n\n\n\n\nFeb-06, 10am PT – Basic ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeakers: Alex Razoumov (SFU) and Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.) and Tyson Whitehead (Western Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView is an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed to run on a variety of hardware from individual laptops to large supercomputers. With ParaView, users can interactively visualize 2D and 3D datasets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles, animate these datasets over time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive visualization through a graphical user interface (GUI) and scripted visualization, including offscreen rendering, and is an easy and enjoyable tool to learn.\nIn this beginner’s workshop, we will explore ParaView’s interface, examine the types of data it can import, and learn how to use filters to build increasingly sophisticated visualization pipelines.\nPrerequisites: Please download and install ParaView v6.0 on your computer, and test that you can start ParaView before the workshop. We will provide all sample datasets.\nPDF slides   ZIP file with all ParaView slides and datasets\n\n\n\n\nFeb-10, 10am PT – The grammar of graphics in R and Python (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Tyson Whitehead (Western Univ.)\nAbstract: Most plotting packages offer a fixed set of built-in plot types to choose from. In contrast, the Grammar of Graphics defines a declarative framework for creating virtually unlimited visualizations by combining geometry, coordinate systems, facets, scales, guides, and themes. The most widely known implementation of this grammar is R’s ggplot2, with a lesser-known Python counterpart called Plotnine. This presentation introduces both libraries and demonstrates how the Grammar of Graphics can be used to build a wide range of plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides, scripts and data   PDF slides   Exploring Minard’s 1812 plot with ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nFeb-13, 10am PT – Introduction à ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView est un outil d’analyse et de visualisation de données à code source ouvert et multiplateforme, conçu pour fonctionner sur une variété de systèmes informatiques, des ordinateurs portatifs aux superordinateurs. Avec ParaView, on peut visualiser de manière interactive des ensembles de données 2D et 3D définis sur des particules ou des maillages structurés, adaptatifs ou non structurés. On peut ensuite animer ces données dans le temps et les manipuler à l’aide de divers filtres. ParaView prend en charge la visualisation interactive via une interface graphique, ainsi que la visualisation par script, y compris le rendu hors écran. C’est un outil facile et agréable à découvrir.\nDans cet atelier d’introduction, nous explorerons l’interface de ParaView, nous examinerons les types de données qu’il peut importer et nous apprendrons à utiliser des filtres pour construire des pipelines de visualisation de plus en plus sophistiqués.\nPrérequis: veuillez télécharger et installer le logiciel ParaView 6.0.1 sur votre ordinateur. Avant l’atelier, assurez-vous de pouvoir démarrer ParaView. Nous fournirons lors de la séance le matériel de formation.\nDiapositives (PDF)   Fichier ZIP contenant le matériel de formation\n\n\n\n\nFeb-24, 10am PT – ParaView scripting (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView’s Python library allows you to automate your visualization workflow by scripting your tasks and running them from the command line, either on your local machine or as a batch Slurm job on a remote HPC cluster, all without opening any windows. In this workshop, we will introduce ParaView’s Python tools, starting with using the Trace feature to convert GUI actions into scripts and then showing how to simplify and modify those scripts. You will learn how to run them using pvpython and pvbatch, and how to explore VTK data from the ParaView Python shell.\nPrerequisites: basic ParaView knowledge (importing and examining data, working with filters). To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nFeb-27, 10am PT – Scripter des visualisations via ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: La bibliothèque Python de ParaView vous permet d’automatiser votre processus de visualisation en programmant des séquences d’actions sous la forme de scripts et en les exécutant en ligne de commande, soit localement, soit via une tâche de calcul sur un superordinateur, le tout sans ouvrir aucune fenêtre de ParaView.\nCet atelier vous présentera les outils Python de ParaView, en commençant par l’utilisation de la fonction Trace pour convertir les actions de l’interface graphique en scripts, puis en vous montrant comment simplifier et modifier ces scripts. Vous apprendrez à les exécuter avec pvpython et pvbatch, et à explorer les données VTK depuis l’interpréteur Python de ParaView.\nPrérequis: connaissances de base de ParaView (importer et examiner des données, utiliser des filtres) et en programmation Python\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-03, 10am PT – ParaView animation (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView supports several approaches to animating data. In this session, we will focus on keyframe animation, where you can animate any property of any pipeline object, e.g. moving a slice through a volume by changing its origin, or animating a 2D contour through a 3D dataset by varying the contour value. We will also look at how to combine multiple timelines within a single animation. After that, we’ll work through several hands-on keyframe animation exercises and discuss how to create animations using Python scripting.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-06, 10am PT – Visualisations animées avec ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView permet d’animer de différentes façons la visualisation de données. Cet atelier sera consacré à l’animation par images clés, soit une méthode permettant d’animer selon n’importe quelle propriété d’un objet du pipeline. Nous verrons, entre autres, comment animer le plan de coupe d’un volume et aussi comment animer un contour 2D, selon sa valeur, dans un jeu de données 3D. Nous verrons également comment combiner plusieurs chronologies au sein d’une même animation. Enfin, nous réaliserons plusieurs exercices pratiques d’animation par images clés et aborderons la création d’animations à l’aide de scripts Python.\nPrérequis: connaissances de base de ParaView (importer et examiner des données, utiliser des filtres) et la compréhension de scripts Python utilisant le module ParaView.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-10, 10am PT – Remote and large-scale visualization in ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: In this more advanced session, you will learn how to perform remote and large-scale visualization on the Alliance’s HPC clusters, for cases where you do not want to – or simply cannot – download the dataset to your local computer.\nSmall-scale remote visualization can be accomplished using JupyterHub or Open OnDemand, running either standalone ParaView or a ParaView client within a remote desktop environment.\nFor larger-scale interactive visualization, we will run a parallel ParaView server for data processing and rendering on a cluster and connect to it from a ParaView client on your local computer. This setup enables interactive visualization of very large datasets (multi-GB and potentially TB-scale) without transferring data locally, and without being limited by your own system’s memory or CPU/GPU resources.\nWe will explore workflows involving both time and camera animation. We will then save the interactive visualization pipeline as a script and run it remotely as a batch job on the cluster, performing all rendering off-screen (without opening any windows) to generate animation files.\nFinally, we will discuss strategies for optimizing data for parallel I/O and the compute resources required to process very large datasets.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions. You will also need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer, to be able to log in to the remote cluster. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-13, 10am PT – Introductory VMD (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Dmitri Rozmanov (Univ. of Calgary)\nAbstract: Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is a dedicated tool for visualizing, analyzing, and animating molecular structures such as proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes, that is often used to post-process molecular dynamics simulations. In this hands-on workshop, attendees will learn to navigate the VMD interface, apply diverse molecular representations, and utilize VMD’s selection language to isolate key residues or ligands. The session will also cover loading molecular dynamics trajectories and generating high-quality renderings suitable for publication. By the end of this workshop, participants will have the fundamental skills to transform raw atomic data into meaningful visual insights.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-17, 10am PT – Programmable Filter / Source in ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView includes two highly flexible scripting tools – the Programmable Filter and Programmable Source – that allow you to design your own data-processing operations. With them, you can construct entirely new spatial discretizations, generate tailored 3D structures, or even import data stored in custom file formats. This hands-on session will demonstrate how these features open up new possibilities for scientific visualization workflows.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-20, 10am PT – Network visualization with Gephi (EN)\n\n\nSpeakers: Jarno van der Kolk (Univ. of Ottawa)\nAbstract: Gephi is an open-source platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs. It lets you visualize how different entities connect with each other. These could be social media networks, researchers publishing papers, internet traffic and so on. It also has robust statistical analysis built-in.\nPrerequisites: Have Gephi installed. Downloads are available at https://gephi.org.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-24, 10am PT – In-situ visualization with ParaView’s Catalyst2 (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: As numerical simulations continue to grow in size and complexity, the I/O bottleneck makes it impossible to save all generated data for later analysis. In-situ techniques address this challenge by running analysis and visualization in real time, while the data are still in memory on the HPC system running the simulation, eliminating the need to write everything to disk. Several in-situ visualization frameworks exist, including ParaView’s Catalyst, VisIt’s LibSim, Ascent, and SENSEI.\nIn this hands-on workshop, we will focus on Catalyst2, which allows you to analyze and visualize your simulation data using familiar ParaView pipelines. Catalyst2 provides an API for describing and passing data arrays – computational meshes and fields – from your simulation to the library, which then converts these arrays into the appropriate VTK data structures. This happens without requiring the user to understand the underlying VTK data model and without duplicating data in memory. This framework is designed to scale to very large datasets and to thousands of CPU cores via MPI.\nThe goal of this workshop is to instrument a simple C code with the Catalyst2 library and produce in-situ outputs, including data extracts and rendered images, using ParaView’s Python scripting.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions. Some knowledge of C would be helpful, but we’ll take things step by step. You will also need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer, to be able to log in to the remote cluster. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-27, 10am PT – Modern tools for web visualization (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: We will begin with a brief overview of the history of general-purpose multidimensional web visualization, including the development of vtk.js and ParaViewWeb. The main focus of this hands-on workshop, however, is to teach you how to use Trame, an open-source framework for building interactive web applications and dashboards for data visualization. Trame leverages Python and popular visualization tools such as VTK and ParaView, and it offers plugins for many other Python plotting libraries.\nIn this session, we will introduce Trame’s core concepts, demonstrate how to create simple interactive visualizations, and show how to put them online for easy sharing. This workshop is ideal for researchers and data scientists who want to turn their static visualizations into interactive, shareable experiences without needing extensive web development expertise.\nAdd to your calendar"

    "title": "Introduction to makefiles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Originally, make command (first released in 1975) was created for automating compilations. Consider a large software project with hundreds of dependencies. When you compile it, each source file is converted into an object file, and then all of them are linked together to the libraries to form a final executable(s) or a final library.\nDay-to-day, you typically work on a small section of the program, e.g. debug a single function, with much of the rest of the program unchanged. When recompiling, it would be a waste of time to recompile all hundreds of source files every time you want to compile/run the code. You need to recompile just a single source file and then update the final executable.\nA makefile is a build manager to automate this process, i.e. to figure out what is up-to-date and what is not, and only run the commands that are necessary to rebuild the final target. A makefile is essentially a tree of dependencies stored in a text file along with the commands to create these dependencies. It ensures that if some of the source files have been updated, we only run the steps that are necessary to create the target with those new source files.\nMakefiles can be used for any project (not just compilation) with multiple steps producing intermediate results, when some of these steps are compute-heavy. Let’s look at an example! We will store the following text in the file text.md:\n## Design\n\nMakefiles can be used for automating any multiple-step workflow\nwhen there is a need to update only some targets, as opposed to\nrunning the entire workflow from start to finish.\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Make's builtin variables\n\n- `$@` is the \"target of this rule\"\n- `$ˆ` is \"all prerequisites of this rule\"\n- `$&lt;` is \"the first prerequisite of this rule\"\n- `$?` is \"all out-of-date prerequisites of this rule\"\nThis is our workflow to automate:\npandoc text.md -t beamer -o text.pdf\n\nwget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/dolphin.png\nmagick dolphin.png dolphin.pdf\n\nwget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/penguin.png\nmagick penguin.png penguin.pdf\n\ngs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=slides.pdf {text,dolphin,penguin}.pdf\n/bin/rm -f dolphin.* penguin.* text.pdf\ncurl -F \"file=@slides.pdf\" https://temp.sh/upload && echo\nFirst version of Makefile automates creating of slides.pdf:\nslides.pdf: text.pdf dolphin.pdf penguin.pdf\n    gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=slides.pdf {text,dolphin,penguin}.pdf\ntext.pdf: text.md\n    pandoc text.md -t beamer -o text.pdf\ndolphin.pdf: dolphin.png\n    magick dolphin.png dolphin.pdf\npenguin.pdf: penguin.png\n    magick penguin.png penguin.pdf\ndolphin.png:\n    wget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/dolphin.png\npenguin.png:\n    wget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/penguin.png\nRunning make will create the target slides.pdf – how many command will it run?

    "section": "",
    "text": "False sharing has no effect in this problem, as for most part individual threads are writing into array elements that are well separated in memory.\nThe row-major vs. column-major order does not matter in the Julia set problem, as it is dominated by computation of individual pixels: computing a single pixel on average takes much longer than writing to a random array element. The timings are virtually identical for row-major vs. column-major, whether in serial or in parallel with @threads. If you were to fill in these elements without computing, then the order would matter, e.g. consider this code:\nusing BenchmarkTools\nfunction testOrder(n::Int, order::Bool)\n    stability = zeros(Int32, n, n)\n    for i in 1:n\n        for j in 1:n\n            order ? stability[i,j] = i+j : stability[j,i] = i+j\n        end\n    end\n    return stability\nend\n@btime testOrder(30_000, true);    # 2.753 s\n@btime testOrder(30_000, false);   # 721.484 ms\n@btime testOrder(1000, true);    # 714.958 μs\n@btime testOrder(1000, false);   # 681.333 μs\nThe real culprit in the Julia set’s bad parallel scaling is the problem’s less-than-perfect load balancing. We know that @threads subdivides the large outer loop equally between the threads. However, some threads have fewer iterations to compute and finish faster, but they have to wait for the threads with more iterations in their pixels. If you modify the code in such a way that all pixels do the same large number of iterations, you will see perfect linear speedup with multi-threading.\nWith the unbalanced load, it is possible to improve performance somewhat with dynamic scheduling using either channels (not covered in our workshop) or Threads.@spawn but it’ll make the code a little bit more complex.\nThe following asynchronous solution was written by Jeremiah O’Neil (University of Ottawa):\nfunction juliaSet(height, width)\n    stability = zeros(Int32, height, width)\n    c = Channel{Int64}(nthreads()) do chnl\n        for i in 1:height\n            put!(chnl, i)\n        end\n    end\n    Threads.foreach(c) do i\n        for j in 1:width\n            point = (2*(j-0.5)/width-1) + (2*(i-0.5)/height-1)im\n            stability[i,j] = pixel(point)\n        end\n    end\n    return stability\nend\nshows better (but still less than linear) speedup."

    "text": "June 12th, 1:30pm-4:30pm Pacific Time\nChapel is a modern programming language designed for both shared and distributed memory systems, offering high-level, easy-to-use abstractions for task and data parallelism. Its intuitive syntax makes it an excellent choice for novice HPC users learning parallel programming. Chapel supports a wide range of parallel hardware – from multicore processors and multi-node clusters to GPUs – using consistent syntax and concepts across all levels of hardware parallelism.\nChapel dramatically reduces the complexity of parallel coding by combining the simplicity of Python-style programming with the performance of compiled languages like C and Fortran. Parallel operations that might require dozens of lines in MPI can often be written in just a few lines of Chapel. As an open-source language, it runs on most Unix-like operating systems and scales from laptops to large HPC systems.\nThis course begins with Chapel fundamentals, then focuses on data parallelism through two numerical examples: one embarrassingly parallel and one tightly coupled. We’ll also briefly explore task parallelism (a more complex topic, and not the primary focus in this course). Finally, we’ll introduce GPU programming with Chapel.\nInstructor: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nPrerequisites: basic understanding of HPC at the introductory level (how to submit jobs with Slurm scheduler) and basic knowledge of the Linux command line.\nSoftware: For the hands-on, we will use Chapel on our training cluster. To access the training cluster, you will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer. On Windows we recommend the free Home Edition of MobaXterm. On Mac and Linux computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there). We will provide guest accounts to all participants. No need to install Chapel on your computer.\n\nSolutions\nYou can find the solutions here.\n\n\nLinks\n\nChapel homepage\nWhat is Chapel?

Next we’ll give a quick tour of various parallel programming frameworks such as OpenMP, MPI, Python Dask, newer parallel languages such as Chapel and Julia, and we’ll try to compile some serial, shared-memory and distributed-memory codes using makefiles. We’ll then proceed to working with the Slurm scheduler, submitting and benchmarking our previously compiled codes. We will learn about batch and interactive cluster usage, best practices for submitting a large number of jobs, estimating your job’s resource requirements, and managing file permissions in shared cluster filesystems.

    "text": "Using Julia on supercomputers\n\nJulia on the Alliance production clusters\nJulia is among hundreds of software packages installed on the Alliance clusters. To use Julia on one of them, you would load the following module:\n$ module spider julia   # show the available versions\n$ module load julia     # load the default version\n\nInstalling Julia packages on a production cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t do this on the training cluster! We already have everything installed in a central location for all guest accounts.\n\n\nBy default, all Julia packages you install from REPL will go into $HOME/.julia, and that we will count against your /home quota. If you want to put packages into another location, you will need to (1) install inside your Julia session with (from within Julia):\nempty!(DEPOT_PATH)\npush!(DEPOT_PATH,\"/scratch/path/to/julia/packages\") \n] add BenchmarkTools\nand (2) before running Julia modify two variables (from the command line):\n$ module load julia\n$ export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/home/\\$USER/.julia:/scratch/path/to/julia/packages\n$ export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=@:@v#.#:@stdlib:/scratch/path/to/julia/packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome Julia packages rely on precompiled bits that developers think would work on all architectures, but they don’t. For example, Plots package comes with several precompiled libraries, it installs without problem on the Alliance clusters, but then at runtime you might see an error about “GLIBC_2.18 not found”. The proper solution would be to recompile the package on the cluster, but it is not done correctly in Julia packaging, and the error persists even after “recompilation”. There is a solution for this, and you can always contact us at support@tech.alliancecan.ca and ask for help. Another example is Julia’s NetCDF package: as of February 2022, it was installing fine on Apple Silicon Macs, but it came with a precompiled C package that had been compiled only for Intel Macs and did not work on M1. This issue has been resolved since then, but the point remains: successful installation of a Julia package does not mean it’ll work on your architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia on the training cluster for this workshop\nWe have Julia on our training cluster julia.vastcloud.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOur training cluster has:\n\n\none fairly small login node,\n\n\n6 compute nodes with 8 cores and 30GB of memory on each  ⟹  3.75GB/core, 48 cores in total\n\n\n\n\nNormally in our introductory Julia course we would use Julia inside a Jupyter notebook. Today we will be starting multiple threads and processes, with the eventual goal of running our workflows as batch jobs on an HPC cluster, so we’ll be using Julia from the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionTraining cluster\n\n\n\nWe will now distribute accounts and passwords to connect to the cluster.\n\n\nNormally, you would install Julia packages yourself. A typical package installation however takes several hundred MBs of RAM, a fairly long time, and creates many small files. Our training cluster runs on top of virtualized hardware with a shared filesystem. If several dozen workshop participants start installing packages at the same time, this will hammer the filesystem and will make it slow for all participants for quite a while.\nInstead, for this workshop, you will run:\n$ source /project/def-sponsor00/shared/julia/config/loadJulia.sh\nThis script loads the Julia module and sets environment variables to point to a central environment in which we have pre-installed all the packages for this workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that you can still install additional packages if you want. These will install in your own environment at ~/.julia.",

Interpreted languages are very convenient since you can run sections of your code as soon as you write them. However, they are slow.\nCompiled languages use compilers: programs that translate your code into machine code. Machine code is extremely efficient, but of course, having to compile your code before being able to run it makes for less convenient workflows when it comes to writing or debugging code.\nJulia uses just-in-time compilation or JIT based on LLVM: the source code is compiled at run time. This combines the flexibility of interpretation with the speed of compilation, bringing speed to an interactive language. It also allows for dynamic recompilation, continuous weighing of gains and costs of the compilation of parts of the code, and other on the fly optimizations.\nHere is a great blog post covering this topic if you want to dive deeper into the functioning of JIT compilers.\n\n\nMacros\nIn the tradition of Lisp, Julia has strong metaprogramming capabilities, in particular in the form of macros.\nMacros are parsed and evaluated first, then their output gets evaluated like a classic expression. This allows the language to modify itself in a reflective manner.\nMacros have a @ prefix and are defined with a syntax similar to that of functions.\n@time for instance is a macro that executes an expression and prints the execution time and other information.\n\n\nFun fact\nJulia supports unicode. In a Julia REPL, type \\:snail: followed by the TAB key, and you get 🐌.\nWhile assigning values to a “snail variable” might not be all that useful, a wide access to – for instance – Greek letters, would make Julia’s code look nicely similar to the equations it represents. For instance, if you type TAB after each variable name, the following:\n\\pgamma = ((\\alpha \\pi + \\beta) / \\delta) + \\upepsilon\nlooks like:\nɣ = ((α π + β) / δ) + ε\nIn Julia you can omit the multiplication sign in some cases, e.g.\njulia&gt; 2π\n6.283185307179586\n\n\nAdditional basic information\nOur beginner’s introduction to Julia course has, amongst others, sections on:\n\nworking with packages\nworking with functions\ncontrol flow\narrays",

It supports distributed computation through MPI.jl. I have not tried it in Julia.\n\n\nElemental.jl\nElemental.jl provides a distributed-memory library of linear algebra routines, including solvers for linear systems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. It supports a wide range of parallel architectures, including multicore CPUs, GPUs, and clusters.

It arises when several threads are writing into variables placed close enough to each other to end up in the same cache line.

If any two threads are updating variables (such as two neighbouring elements in our total array here) that end up in the same cache line, the cache line will have to migrate between the two threads’ caches, reducing the performance.\nIn general, you want to align shared global data (thread partitions in the array total in our case) to cache line boundaries, or avoid storing thread-specific data in an array indexed by the thread id or rank.

Let’s take a look at sort() and sort!():\nn = Int64(1e8)\nr = rand(Float32, (n));   # random floats in [0, 1]\nr[1:10]      # first 20 elements, same as first(r,10)\nlast(r,10)   # last 10 elements\n\n?sort              # underneath uses QuickSort (for numeric arrays) or MergeSort\n@btime sort(r);    # 10.421 s, serial sorting\n@btime sort!(r);   # 1.707 s, in-place serial sorting\n\nr = rand(Float32, (n));\n@btime ThreadsX.sort(r);    # 2.950 ms, parallel sorting with 4 threads\n@btime ThreadsX.sort!(r);   # 1.115 ms, in-place parallel sorting with 4 threads\n?ThreadsX.sort!             # there is actually a good manual page\n\n# similar speedup for integers\nr = rand(Int32, (n));\n@btime sort!(r);   # 1.065 ms in serial\n\nr = rand(Int32, (n));\n@btime ThreadsX.sort!(r);   # 1.058 ms with 4 threads\nSearching for extrema is much more parallel-friendly:\nn = Int64(1e9)\nr = rand(Int32, (n));        # make sure we have enough memory\n@btime maximum(r)            # 328.375 ms\n@btime ThreadsX.maximum(r)   # 82.562 ms with 4 threads\nFinally, another useful function is ThreadsX.map() without reduction – we will take a closer look at it in one of the following sections.\nTo sum up this section, ThreadsX.jl provides a super easy way to parallelize some of the Base library functions. It includes multi-threaded reduction and shows very impressive parallel performance. To list the supported functions, use ThreadsX.&lt;TAB&gt;, and don’t forget to use the built-in help pages.",

Fundamentally, these tools let you create custom VTK objects directly from ParaView. Let’s say we want to plot a projection of a cubic dataset along one of its principal axes, or do some other transformation for which there is no filter.\n\nCalculator / Python Calculator filter cannot modify the geometry …\n\n\nVTK data types\n\nIn today’s examples we will create datasets in the following formats:\n\nvtkImageData,\nvtkPolyData, and\nvtkStructuredGrid.\n\nFor simplicity, we will skip the examples with Output Data Set Type = vtkUnstructuredGrid – that would produce the most versatile object, but with any unstructured cells you will have to describe the connections between their points needed to form these cells. You can find a couple of examples of creating vtkUnstructuredGrid in a 2021 webinar.\n\n\nProgrammable Filter workflow\n\nApply Programmable Filter to a ParaView pipeline object\nSelect Output Data Set Type: either Same as Input, or one of the VTK data types from above\nIn the Script box, write Python code: input from a pipeline object → output\n\n\nuse inputs[0].Points[:,0:3] and/or inputs[0].PointData['array name'] and/or inputs[0].CellData['array name'] to compute your output: points, cells, and data arrays\nsome objects take/pass multiple inputs[:]\n\n\n\n\nDepending on output’s type, might need to describe it in the RequestInformation Script box\nHit Apply\n\n\n\nProgrammable Source workflow\nSame as Programmable Filter but without an input.\n\nbuild an object programmatically\nread and process data from a file"

I used the formulae from the wiki page to write my own function:\nfrom math import sin, cos, pi, sqrt, radians\ndef mollweide(lon, lat):\n    \"\"\"\n    lon: input longitude in degrees\n    lat: input latitude in degrees\n    \"\"\"\n    lam, phi = radians(lon), radians(lat)\n    lam0 = radians(180)   # central meridian\n    tolerance = 1.0e-5\n    if abs(abs(phi)-pi/2.) &lt; tolerance:\n        theta = phi\n    else:\n        theta, dtheta = phi, 1e3\n        while abs(dtheta) &gt; tolerance:\n            twotheta = 2 * theta\n            dtheta = theta\n            theta = theta - (twotheta + sin(twotheta) - pi*sin(phi))/(2 + 2*cos(twotheta))\n            dtheta -= theta\n    s2 = sqrt(2)\n    x = 2 * s2/pi * (lam-lam0) * cos(theta)\n    y = s2 * sin(theta)\n    return (x,y)\n\nlam = data.lon.values[100]\nphi = data.lat.values[50]\nmollweide(lam,phi)\n\n\nBack to ParaView\nOur goal is to create something like this: \n\nload compact150.nc, uncheck Spherical Coordinates\napply Programmable Filter, set Output Data Set Type = vtkStructuredGrid\nlet’s start playing with the data in the Script dialogue:\n\nprint(inputs[0].GetNumberOfPoints())         # 13024800 = 360*201*180\npointIndex = 0   # any inteteger between 0 and 13024799\nprint(inputs[0].GetPoint(pointIndex)[0:3])   # (0.0, 3485.0, 90.0)\nprint(inputs[0].PointData['temperature'])\nprint(inputs[0].PointData[\"temperature\"].GetValue(pointIndex))\nWe can paste the entire mollweide(lon, lat) function definition into the Programmable Filter, or – to shorten the code inside the filter – we can load it from a file. Let’s save it in mollweide.py and then test it from a standalone Python shell:\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, \"/Users/razoumov/programmableFilter\")\nfrom mollweide import mollweide\nmollweide(100,3)\nHere is what our filter will look like:\nfrom math import sin, cos, pi, sqrt, radians\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, \"/Users/razoumov/programmableFilter\")\nfrom mollweide import mollweide\n\ntemp_in = inputs[0].PointData[\"temperature\"]\n\nnlon, nr, nlat = 360, 201, 180\npoints = vtk.vtkPoints()\npoints.Allocate(nlon*nr*nlat)\ntemp = vtk.vtkDoubleArray() # create vtkPoints instance, to contain 100^2 points in the projection\ntemp.SetName(\"temperature\")\n\noutput.SetExtent([0,nlon-1,0,nr-1,0,nlat-1])   # should match SetOutputWholeExtent below\nx, y = np.zeros((nlon,nlat)), np.zeros((nlon,nlat))\nfor i in range(nlat):   # the order of loops should reverse-match SetExtent\n    for j in range(nr):\n        for k in range(nlon):\n            inx = k + i*nlon*nr + j*nlon\n            if j == 0:   # inner radius = base layer\n                lon, r, lat = inputs[0].GetPoint(inx)[0:3]\n                x[k,i], y[k,i] = mollweide(lon,lat)\n            points.InsertNextPoint(x[k,i],y[k,i],0.01*j)\n            temp.InsertNextValue(temp_in.GetValue(inx))\n\noutput.SetPoints(points)\noutput.GetPointData().SetScalars(temp)\nOptionally, you can paste the following into RequestInformation Script:\nfrom paraview import util\nnlon, nr, nlat = 360, 201, 180\nutil.SetOutputWholeExtent(self,[0,nlon-1,0,nr-1,0,nlat-1])   # the order is fixed and copied from input"

Now we have a plot in the phi-r plane, i.e. in polar coordinates. Phi goes [0,2\\(\\pi\\)], whereas r goes [0,1].\n?fig.add_subplot    # look into `projection` parameter\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='mollweide')\nlon = np.radians(np.linspace(30,90,10))\nlat = np.radians(np.linspace(15,18,10))\nplt.plot(lon, lat, 'go-')\nYou can use this projection parameter together with cartopy package to process 2D geospatial data to produce maps, while all plotting is still being done by Matplotlib.

The Python interpreter can’t make any assumptions about what will come next in a list, so it treats everything as a generic object with its own type and size. As lists get longer, eventually performance takes a hit.\nPython does not have any mechanism for a uniform/homogeneous list, where – to jump to element #1000 – you just take the memory address of the very first element and then increment it by (element size in bytes) x 999. NumPy library fills this gap by adding the concept of homogenous collections to python – numpy.ndarrays – which are multidimensional, homogeneous arrays of fixed-size items (most commonly numbers, but could be strings too). This brings huge performance benefits!\nTo speed up calculations with NumPy, typically you perform operations on entire arrays, and this by extension applies the same operation to each array element. Since NumPy was written in C, it is much faster for processing multiple data elements than manually looping over these elements in Python.\nLearning NumPy is outside the scope of this introductory workshop, but there are many packages built on top of NumPy that could be used in HSS:\n\npandas is a library for working with 2D tables / spreadsheets, built on top of numpy\nscikit-image is a collection of algorithms for image processing, built on top of numpy\nMatplotlib and Plotly are two plotting packages for Python\nxarray is a library for working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays and datasets in Python\n\n“pandas for multi-dimensional arrays”\ngreat for large scientific datasets; writes into NetCDF files\nwe won’t study it in this workshop\n\n\nWe’ll also take a look at these two libraries (not based on NumPy): - requests is an HTTP library to download HTML data from the web - Beautiful Soup is a library to parse these HTML data",

There are three scenarios:\n\nIf we have the principal amount and the term in years, here is how you would calculate the monthly payment:\n\nr = rate / 1200\nq = (1 + r)**(12*term)\npayment = principal * r * q / (q - 1)\n\nIf we have the monthly payment and the principal amount, here is how you would calculate the term in years:\n\nr = rate / 1200\nq =  payment / (payment - principal * r)\nif q &lt; 0.:\n    print(\"you will never pay it off ...\")\n    exit(1)\nterm = log(q) / (log(1+r)*12)\n\nIf we have the term in years and the monthly payment, here is how you would calculate the principal amount:\n\nr = rate / 1200\nq = (1 + r)**(12*term)\nprincipal = payment * (q - 1) / (r * q)\nHow can we tell the code to decide on the fly which variable it needs to compute, based on the two existing ones?\nWe would like to do something like this (not actual Python code):\nif payment is not defined:\n    use formula 1\nif term is not defined:\n    use formula 2\nif principal is not defined:\n    use formula 3\nConsider this syntax:\ntry:\n    someUndefinedVariable       # here is what we try to do\nexcept NameError:\n    someUndefinedVariable = 1   # if that produces NameError, don't show it, but do this instead\n    print(someUndefinedVariable)\nAnd you can combine multiple error codes, e.g.\n...\nexcept (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 9.1\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the rest of the mortgage calculation code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can also implement this code setting payment = None for a missing variable, and then placing the code under if payment == None condition. Alternatively, you can put everything into a function with optional arguments that default to None unless assigned values. I personally like the implementation with the exception handling, as this way you don’t have to assign the missing variable at all.",

There are hundreds of data processing, machine learning, and visualization libraries.\nPython can handle much larger amounts of data: limited not by Python, but by your available computing resources. In addition, Python can run at scale (in parallel) on larger systems.\nPython is more reproducible (rerun / modify the script).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython vs. other programming languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython pros\nPython cons\n\n\n\n\nelegant scripting language\nslow (interpreted, dynamically typed)\n\n\neasy to write and read code\nuses indentation for code blocks\n\n\npowerful, compact constructs for many tasks\n\n\n\nvery popular across all fields\n\n\n\nhuge number of external libraries",

    "section": "Mounting external directories and copying environment",
    "text": "Mounting external directories and copying environment\nBy default, Apptainer containers are read-only, so you cannot write into its directories. However, from inside the container you can organize read-write access to your directories on the host filesystem. The command\napptainer shell -B /home,/project,/scratch ubuntu.sif\nwill bind-mount /home,/project,/scratch inside the container so that these directories can be accessed for both read and write, subject to your account’s permissions, and then will run a shell. Inside the container:\npwd     # most likely your working directory\necho $USER\nls /home\nls /scratch\nls /project\nIf you prefer, you can pass the same bind information via an environment variable APPTAINER_BIND. In fact, by default your APPTAINER_BIND is set to /project,/scratch, so these two directories (along with /home/$USER) will be mounted every time. If you want to stop mounting /project and /scratch, unset the variable:\nunset APPTAINER_BIND\napptainer shell ubuntu.sif\nYou can mount host directories to specific paths inside the container, e.g.\napptainer shell -B /project/def-sponsor00/$USER:/myproject,/home/$USER/scratch:/myscratch ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; ls /myproject\nApptainer&gt; ls /myscratch\nNote that by default Apptainer typically mounts some of the host’s directories (think /home/$USER). The flag -C will hide the host’s filesystems and environment variables, but then you need to explicitly bind-mount the needed paths (to store results), e.g.\napptainer shell -C -B /scratch ubuntu.sif   # from the host see only /scratch\nApptainer&gt; ls /home/$USER     # still there, but does not contain host's files and directories\n\n\nYou can disable specific mounts, e.g. the following will start the container without mounting your home directory, but it’ll mount the current directory:\napptainer shell --no-mount home ubuntu.sif\nAlternatively, you can disable mounting /home with the --no-home flag, which is equivalent to --no-mount home. And you can disable multiple mounts with something like --no-mount tmp,sys,dev.\nIn general, without -C, Apptainer inherits all environment variables and default bind-mounted filesystems. You can add the -e flag to remove only the host’s environment variables from your container but keep the default bind-mounted filesystems, to start in a cleaner environment:\napptainer shell ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; echo $USER $PYTHONPATH         # defined from the host\nApptainer&gt; ls /home/user01                # shows my $HOME content on the host\n\napptainer shell -C ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; echo $USER $PYTHONPATH         # not defined\nApptainer&gt; ls /home/user01                # nothing\n\napptainer shell -e ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; echo $USER $PYTHONPATH         # not defined\nApptainer&gt; ls /home/user01                # shows my $HOME content on the host\nOn the other hand, you can pass variables to your container by prefixing their names:\nAPPTAINERENV_HI=\"hello\" APPTAINERENV_NAME=\"alex\" apptainer shell ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; echo $HI     # should print hello\nApptainer&gt; echo $NAME   # should print alex\nFinally, we already mentioned APPTAINER_BIND: you don’t have to pass the same bind (-B) flags every time – instead you can put them into a variable (that can be stored in your ~/.bashrc file):\nexport APPTAINER_BIND=\"/home,/project/def-sponsor00/${USER}:/project,/scratch/${USER}:/scratch\"\napptainer shell ubuntu.sif\nYou can have more granular control (e.g. specifying read only) with the --mount flag – for details see the official Bind Paths and Mounts documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey points\n\n\n\n\nYour current directory and home directory are usually available by default in a container.\nYou have the same username and permissions in a container as on the host system.\nUse -B to mount host’s directories inside the container.\nUse -C to hide both host’s filesystems and environment variables, perhaps while mounting only few specific directories.\nUse -e to hide only the host’s environment variables.",

In this workshop, we aim to cover topics that are not typically included in our curriculum. We asked for your input on which topics should be prioritized, and we really appreciate all your answers! The responses we got mostly fell into two categories: topics that are already covered in our bash, introductory HPC, and beginner’s Python courses, or more specialized topics. Within this two-hour workshop, we will try to balance these suggestions while showing tools that will be useful to a wide range of people who use our HPC clusters or command line independently on their own computers. We will cover, among other things, aliases, scripts, functions, make, tmux, fuzzy finder, bat, color setup for your shell, zsh plugins, and autojump. We will provide a training cluster and guest accounts to try all these tools and will explain how to install them on production clusters."

    "title": "Answering your Bash questions",
    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nFunctions are similar to scripts, but there are some differences. A bash script is an executable file sitting at a given path. A bash function is defined in your shell environment. Therefore, when running a script, you need to prepend its path to its name, whereas a function – once defined in your environment – can be called by its name without a need for a path. Both scripts and functions can take command-line arguments.\nA convenient place to put all your function definitions is ~/.bashrc file which is run every time you start a new shell (local or remote).\nLike in any programming language, in bash a function is a block of code that you can access by its name. The syntax is:\nfunctionName() {\n  command 1\n  command 2\n  ...\n}\nInside functions you can access its arguments with variables $1 $2 … $# $@ – exactly the same as in scripts. Functions are very convenient because you can define them once inside your ~/.bashrc file and then forget about them.\nHere is our first function:\ngreetings() {\n  echo hello\n}\nLet’s write a function combine() that takes all the files we pass to it, moves them into a randomly-named directory and prints that directory to the screen:\ncombine() {\n  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"No arguments specified. Usage: combine file1 [file2 ...]\"\n    return 1        # return a non-zero error code\n  fi\n  dir=$RANDOM$RANDOM\n  mkdir $dir\n  mv $@ $dir\n  echo look in the directory $dir\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise Swap file names\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function to swap two file names. Add a check that both files exist, before renaming them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise archive()\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function archive() to replace directories with their gzipped archives.\n$ mkdir -p chapter{1..5} notes\n$ ls -F\nchapter1/  chapter2/  chapter3/  chapter4/  chapter5/  notes/\n$ archive chapter* notes/\n$ ls\nchapter1.tar.gz  chapter2.tar.gz  notes.tar.gz\n\n\n\nI will leave it to you to write the reverse function unarchive() that replaces a gzipped tarball with a directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise countfiles()\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function countfiles() to count files in all directories passed to it as arguments (need to loop through all arguments). At the beginning add the check:\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"No arguments given. Usage: countfiles dir1 dir2 ...\"\n    return 1\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use functions to expand existing bash commands. Here is a function I wrote recently that adds some functionality to git-annex &lt;verb&gt; command:\nfunction ga() {\n    case $1 in\n    init|status|add|sync|drop|dropunused|unannex|unused|find|whereis|info|copy|move|get)\n        git-annex $@\n        ;;\n    st)\n        git-annex status\n        ;;\n    locate)\n        git-annex whereis --json \"${@:2}\" | jq '.file + \" \" + (.whereis|map(.description)|join(\",\"))' \\\n        | sed -e 's|\\\"||g'\n        ;;\n    here)\n        git-annex find \"${@:2}\"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo command not found ...\n        ;;\n    esac\n}"

    "href": "bash-questions.html#make",
    "title": "Answering your Bash questions",
    "section": "Make",
    "text": "Make\nOriginally, make command (first released in 1975) was created for automating compilations. Consider a large software project with hundreds of dependencies. When you compile it, each source file is converted into an object file, and then all of them are linked together to the libraries to form a final executable(s) or a final library.\nDay-to-day, you typically work on a small section of the program, e.g. debug a single function, with much of the rest of the program unchanged. When recompiling, it would be a waste of time to recompile all hundreds of source files every time you want to compile/run the code. You need to recompile just a single source file and then update the final executable.\nA makefile is a build manager to automate this process, i.e. to figure out what is up-to-date and what is not, and only run the commands that are necessary to rebuild the final target. A makefile is essentially a tree of dependencies stored in a text file along with the commands to create these dependencies. It ensures that if some of the source files have been updated, we only run the steps that are necessary to create the target with those new source files.\nMakefiles can be used for any project (not just compilation) with multiple steps producing intermediate results, when some of these steps are compute-heavy. Let’s look at an example! We will store the following text in the file text.md:\n## Part 1\n\nIn this part we cover:\n\n- bash aliases\n- bash scripts\n- bash functions\n- make\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Part 2\n\nIn this part we cover:\n\n- tmux (also in the context of process control)\n- fuzzy finder\n- bat\n- color setup for your shell\n- zsh plugins\n- autojump\nThis is our workflow:\npandoc text.md -t beamer -o text.pdf\n\nwget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/dolphin.png\nmagick dolphin.png dolphin.pdf\n\nwget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/penguin.png\nmagick penguin.png penguin.pdf\n\ngs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=slides.pdf {text,dolphin,penguin}.pdf\n/bin/rm -f dolphin.* penguin.* text.pdf\ncurl -F \"file=@slides.pdf\" https://temp.sh/upload && echo\nFirst version of Makefile automates creating of slides.pdf:\nslides.pdf: text.pdf dolphin.pdf penguin.pdf\n    gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=slides.pdf {text,dolphin,penguin}.pdf\ntext.pdf: text.md\n    pandoc text.md -t beamer -o text.pdf\ndolphin.pdf: dolphin.png\n    magick dolphin.png dolphin.pdf\npenguin.pdf: penguin.png\n    magick penguin.png penguin.pdf\ndolphin.png:\n    wget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/dolphin.png\npenguin.png:\n    wget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/penguin.png\nRunning make will create the target slides.pdf – how many command will it run? That depends on how many intermediate files you have, and their timestamps.\nTest 1: let’s modify text.md, e.g. add a line there. The makefile will figure out what needs to be done to update slides.pdf. How many command will it run?\nTest 2: let’s remove dolphin.png. How many commands will make run?\nTest 3: let’s remove both PNG files. How many commands will make run?\nNow, add three special targets at the end:\nclean:\n    /bin/rm -f dolphin.* penguin.* text.pdf\ncleanall:\n    make clean\n    /bin/rm -f slides.pdf\nupload: slides.pdf\n    curl -F \"file=@slides.pdf\" https://temp.sh/upload && echo\nNext, we can make use of make’s builtin variables:\n\n$@ is the “target of this rule”\n$ˆ is “all prerequisites of this rule”\n$&lt; is “the first prerequisite of this rule”\n$? is “all out-of-date prerequisites of this rule”\n\n&lt; gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=slides.pdf {text,dolphin,penguin}.pdf\n---\n&gt; gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=$@ $^\n&lt; pandoc text.md -t beamer -o text.pdf\n---\n&gt; pandoc $^ -t beamer -o $@\nThe next simplification makes use of make wildcards to specify patterns:\n&lt; dolphin.pdf: dolphin.png\n&lt;   magick dolphin.png dolphin.pdf\n&lt; penguin.pdf: penguin.png\n&lt;   magick penguin.png penguin.pdf\n---\n&gt; %.pdf: %.png\n&gt;   magick $^ $@"

    "text": "Fuzzy finder fzf\nfzf – stands for “fuzzy finder” – is an interactive filter for files or for standard input. You can type with errors and omitted characters and still get the correct results.\nIf we call it as is, fzf, it will traverse the file system under the current directory to get the list of files. Type something and then:\n\nuse up/down arrows or pageup/pagedown to navigate the list\nhit return to return the selected line\nhit backspace to modify your search\nhit TAB multiple times to select multiple lines\nhit Shift-TAB to deselect\nhit escape to exit search\n\nIt is a very quick way to find a file interactively.\nYou can control fzf appearance / real estate:\nfzf                # by default take the entire screen\nfzf --height 10%   # start below the cursor with the 10% height\nfzf --tmux         # this flag is not available on clusters\nThere are many other options for formatting fzf’s output – you can find them in the documentation, so I won’t cover them here.\nHere is a useful function to find a file and open it in nano:\nfunction nn() {\n    nano $(fzf)\n}\nHere is a more sophisticated version of this function, with a couple of improvements:\n\nwon’t open nano if you have an empty result (Esc or Ctrl-C)\ncan handle spaces in file names\n\nfunction nn() {\n    fzf --bind 'enter:become(nano {+})'\n}\n\n--bind binds Enter key to running nano\n\nA more interesting use of fzf is to process standard output of other commands:\nhistory | fzf\n\nfind ~/projects/def-sponsor00/shared/ -type f | fzf\nfind ~/projects/def-sponsor00/shared/ -type f | fzf --preview 'more {}'\nfind ~/projects/def-sponsor00/shared/ -type f | fzf --preview 'head -5 {}'\n\ngit show $(git rev-list --all) | fzf   # search through file changes in all previous commits\n\ncat ~/Documents/notes/*.md | wc -l     # 91k lines of text\ncat ~/Documents/notes/*.md | fzf       # just the content (no file names)\ngrep . ~/Documents/notes/*.md | fzf    # if you want to see the file names as well\nYou can act on the results of search:\nfunction playLocalMusic() {\n    dir=${HOME}/Music/Music/Media.localized/Music\n    player=/Applications/Tiny*Player.app/Contents/MacOS/Tiny*Player\n    find $dir -type d | fzf | sed 's| |\\\\ |g' | xargs $player\n}\nYou can use selected fields in the fzf’s output:\nfunction kk() {\n    kill -9 `/bin/ps ux | fzf | awk '{print $2}'`\n}\n\nAuto-completion\n\nIn bash, you can complete commands by pressing  once or twice. If you want to replace that with fzf, i.e. if you want to use fzf inline inside your commands, you can enable fzf completion that will replace a completion trigger (** by default) with the fzf’s output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nfzf in CVMFS does not seem to have been compiled with completion support. To enable it on the training cluster, you will need to install fzf into your own directory, which is fortunately very easy:\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git fzf\n./fzf/install   # answer \"yes\" to enable fuzzy auto-completion\nexport PATH=${HOME}/fzf/bin:${PATH}        # add fzf to PATH\nsource ${HOME}/fzf/shell/completion.bash   # enable completion support\n\n\nbat **&lt;TAB&gt;\nbat &lt;dir&gt;/**&lt;TAB&gt;\nIt is most useful when you run it pointing to a large subdirectory, e.g.\nnano ~/Documents/**&lt;TAB&gt;\ncd ~/training/**&lt;TAB&gt;\nIt is context-aware:\nkill -9 **&lt;TAB&gt;\nssh **&lt;TAB&gt;\nunset **&lt;TAB&gt;\nunalias **&lt;TAB&gt;"

For example, Ray is quite verbose when you do things in it. To turn off this logging output to the terminal, you can do\nray.init(configure_logging=False)   # hide Ray's copious logging output\nYou can run ray.init() only once. If you want to re-run it, first you need to run ray.shutdown(). Alternatively, you can pass the argument ignore_reinit_error=True to the call.\nYou can specify the number of cores for Ray to use, and you can combine multiple options, e.g.\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\nBy default Ray will use all available CPU cores, e.g. on my laptop ray.init() will start 8 ray::IDLE processes (workers), and you can monitor these in a separate shell with htop --filter \"ray::IDLE\" command (you may want to hide threads – typically thrown in green – with Shift+H).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDiscussion\n\n\n\nHow many “ray::IDLE” processes do you see, and why?

    "text": "Ray tasks\nIn Ray you can execute any Python function asynchronously on separate workers. Such functions are called Ray remote functions, and their asynchronous invocations are called Ray tasks:\nimport ray\nray.init(configure_logging=False)   # optional\n\n@ray.remote             # declare that we want to run this function remotely\ndef square(x):\n    return x * x\n\nr = square.remote(10)   # launch/schedule a remote calculation (non-blocking call)\ntype(r)                 # ray._raylet.ObjectRef (object reference)\nray.get(r)              # retrieve the result (=100) (blocking call)\nThe calculation may happen any time between &lt;function&gt;.remote() and ray.get() calls, i.e. it does not necessarily start when you launch it. This is called lazy execution: the operation is often executed when you try to access the result.\na = square.remote(10)   # launch a remote calculation\nray.cancel(a)           # cancel it\nray.get(a)              # either error or 100, depending on whether the calculation\n                        # has finished before cancellation\nYou can launch several Ray tasks at once, to be executed in parallel in the background, and you can retrieve their results either individually or through the list:\nr = [square.remote(i) for i in range(4)]   # launch four parallel tasks (non-blocking call)\nprint([ray.get(r[i]) for i in range(4)])   # retrieve the results (multiple blocking calls)\nprint(ray.get(r))          # more compact way to do the same (single blocking call)\n\nTask output\nConsider a code in which each Ray task sleeps for 10 seconds, prints a message and returns its task ID:\nimport ray\nfrom time import sleep, time\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\n@ray.remote\ndef nap():\n    sleep(10)\n    print(\"almost done\")\n    return ray.get_runtime_context().get_task_id()\nLet’s run it with timing on:\nstart = time()\nr = [nap.remote() for i in range(4)]\nray.get(r)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nI get 10.013 seconds since I have enough cores to run all of them in parallel. However, most likely, I see printout (“almost done”) from only one process and a message “repeated 3x across cluster”. To enable print messages from all tasks, you need set the bash shell environment variable export RAY_DEDUP_LOGS=0.\nNotice that Ray task IDs are not integers but 48-character hexadecimal numbers.\n\n\nDistributed progress bars\nWe used tqdm.tqdm() progress bars earlier in the NumPy section. Ray has its own tqdm():\nfrom ray.experimental.tqdm_ray import tqdm\n\n@ray.remote\ndef busy(name):\n    if \"2\" in name: sleep(5)\n    for x in tqdm(range(100), desc=name):\n        sleep(0.1)\n\nbusy.remote(\"task 1\")   # runs write away\nbusy.remote(\"task 2\")   # sleeps for 5s and then runs\n\n[busy.remote(\"task 1\"), busy.remote(\"task 2\")]\nA side effect of tqdm() is that these tasks start running immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 11b\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement the same for 10 tasks using a for loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRay’s tqdm() is somewhat buggy, so you might want to restart Python and your Ray cluster, if you don’t want to see artifacts from previous bars sometimes popping up in your session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParallelizing the slow series with Ray tasks\nLet’s perform our slow series calculation as a Ray task. This is our original serial implementation, now with a Ray remote function running on one of the workers:\nfrom time import time\nimport ray\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\n@ray.remote\ndef slow(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\nr = slow.remote(100_000_000)\ntotal = ray.get(r)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nWe should get the same timing as before (~6-7 seconds). You can call ray.get() on the previously computed result again without having to redo the calculation:\nstart = time()\ntmp = ray.get(r)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))   # 0.001 seconds\nprint(tmp)\nLet’s speed up this calculation with parallel Ray tasks! Instead of doing the full sum over range(1,n+1), let’s calculate a partial sum on each task:\nfrom time import time\nimport psutil, ray\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\n@ray.remote\ndef slow(interval):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(interval[0],interval[1]+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\nThis would be a serial calculation:\nn = 100_000_000\nstart = time()\nr = slow.remote((1, n))   # takes in one argument\ntotal = ray.get(r)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nTo launch it in parallel, we need to subdivide the interval:\nncores = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)   # good option on a standalone computer\nncores = 4                                 # on a cluster\n\nsize = n//ncores   # size of each batch\nintervals = [(i*size+1,(i+1)*size) for i in range(ncores)]\nif n &gt; intervals[-1][1]: intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], n)   # add the remainder (if any)\n\nstart = time()\nr = [slow.remote(intervals[i]) for i in range(ncores)]\ntotal = sum(ray.get(r))   # compute total sum\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nOn 8 cores I get the average runtime of 1.282 seconds – not too bad, considering that some of the cores are low-efficiency (slower) cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 12\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease n to 1_000_000_000 and run htop --filter \"ray in a separate shell to monitor CPU usage of individual processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Numba-compiled functions as Ray tasks\nWe ended Part 1 with a Numba-compiled version of the slow series code that works almost as well as a Julia/Chapel code. As you just saw, Ray itself can distribute the calculation, speeding up the code with parallel execution, but individual tasks still run native Python code that is slow.\nWouldn’t it be great if we could use Ray to distribute execution of Numba-compiled functions to workers? It turns out we can, but we have to be careful with syntax. We would need to define remote compiled functions, but neither Ray, nor Numba let you combine their decorators (@ray.remote and @numba.jit, respectively) for a single function. You can do this in two steps:\nimport ray\nfrom numba import jit\n\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef square(x):\n    return x*x\n\n@ray.remote\ndef runCompiled():\n    return square(5)\n\nr = runCompiled.remote()\nray.get(r)\nHere we “jit” the function on the main process and send it to workers for execution. Alternatively, you can “jit” on workers:\nimport ray\nfrom numba import jit\n\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x*x\n\n@ray.remote\ndef runCompiled():\n    compiledSquare = jit(square)\n    return compiledSquare(5)\n\nr = runCompiled.remote()\nray.get(r)\nIn my tests with more CPU-intensive functions, both versions produce very similar runtimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 13 (BIG ONE): combining Numba and Ray remotes for the slow series\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a slow series solver with Numba-compiled functions executed as Ray tasks.\n1. Numba-compiled combined(k) that returns either 1/x or 0.\n2. Numba-compiled slow(interval) for partial sums.\n3. Ray-enabled remote function runCompiled(interval) to launch partial sums on workers.\n4. Very important step: you must do small runCompiled() runs on workers to copy code over to them – no need to time these runs. Without this “pre-compilation” step you will not get fast execution on workers on the bigger problem.\n5. The rest of the code will look familiar:\nstart = time()\nr = [runCompiled.remote(intervals[i]) for i in range(ncores)]\ntotal = sum(ray.get(r))   # compute total sum\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAveraged (over three runs) times:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n0.439\n0.235\n0.130\n0.098\n\n\n\nUsing a combination of Numba and Ray tasks on 8 cores, we accelerated the calculation by ~68X.\n\n\nGetting partial results from Ray tasks\nConsider the following code:\nfrom time import sleep\nimport ray, random\n\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\n@ray.remote\ndef longSleep():\n    duration = random.randint(1,100) # random integer from [1,100]\n    sleep(duration)   # sleep for this number of seconds\n    return f\"I slept for {duration} seconds\"\n\nrefs = [longSleep.remote() for x in range(1,21)]   # start 20 tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRunning time\n\n\n\nWe have 4 Ray workers (hopefully, running on 4 CPU cores) and 20 tasks, each taking between 1s and 100s, so it’ll likely take 5 tasks per worker and ~250s on average to run.\n\n\nIf we now call ray.get(refs), that would block until all of these remote tasks finish. If we want to, let’s say, one of them to finish and then continue on the main task, we can do:\nready_refs, remaining_refs = ray.wait(refs, num_returns=1, timeout=None) # wait for one of them to finish\nprint(ready_refs, remaining_refs)   # print the IDs of the finished task, and the other 19 IDs\nray.get(ready_refs)                 # get finished results\nLet’s wait for the first 5 answers:\nready_refs, remaining_refs = ray.wait(refs, num_returns=5, timeout=None) # wait for 5 of them to finish\nray.get(ready_refs)                 # get finished results\nfor i in remaining_refs:\n    ray.cancel(i)   # cancel the unfinished ones\n\n\nMultiple returns from Ray tasks\nSimilar to normal Python functions, Ray tasks can return tuples:\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef threeNumbers():\n    return 10, 20, 30\n\nr = threeNumbers.remote()\nprint(ray.get(r)[0])        # get the result (tuple) and show its first element\nAlternatively, you can pipe each number to a separate object ref (tell the decorator!):\n@ray.remote(num_returns=3)\ndef threeNumbers():\n    return 10, 20, 30\n\nr1, r2, r3 = threeNumbers.remote()\nray.get(r1)   # get the first result only\nYou can also create a remote generator that will return only one number at a time, to reduce memory usage:\n@ray.remote(num_returns=3)\ndef threeNumbers():\n    for i in range(3):   # should return 10,20,30\n        yield (i+1)*10\n\nr1, r2, r3 = threeNumbers.remote()\nray.get(r2)   # get second first number only\n\n\nLinking remote tasks\nIn addition to values, object refs can also be passed to remote functions. Define two functions:\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef one():\n    return 1\n\n@ray.remote\ndef increment(value):\n    return value + 1\nIn by-now familiar syntax:\nr1 = one.remote()                    # create the first Ray task\nr2 = increment.remote(ray.get(r1))   # pass its result as an argument to another Ray task\nprint(ray.get(r2))\nYou can also shorten this syntax:\nr1 = one.remote()           # create the first Ray task\nr2 = increment.remote(r1)   # pass its object ref as an argument to another Ray task\nprint(ray.get(r2))\nAs the second task depends on the output of the first task, Ray will not execute the second task until the first task has finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent storage on Ray workers\n\nBy now, you might have noticed that Ray functions (remote tasks) are stateless, i.e. they can run on any processor that happens to be more idle at the time, and they do not store any data on that processor in between the function calls.\nIf you are trying to parallelize a tightly-coupled problem, you might want to store arrays on the workers permanently, and then repeatedly call quick functions to do some computations on these arrays, without copying the arrays back and forth at each step.\nTo do this in Ray, we can use Ray actors. A Ray actor is essentially a stateful (bound to a CPU core) worker that is created via a Python class instance with its own persistent variables and methods, and it stays permanently on that worker until we destroy this instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\nclass ArrayStorage:         # define an actor (ArrayStorage class) with a persistent array\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.array = None   # persistent array variable\n    def store_array(self, arr):\n        self.array = arr    # store an array in the actor's state\n    def get_array(self):\n        return self.array   # retrieve the stored array\n\nstorage_actor = ArrayStorage.remote()   # create an instance of the actor\n\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nray.get(storage_actor.store_array.remote(arr))   # store an array\n   # Question: why use `ray.get()` here?\n\nr = ray.get(storage_actor.get_array.remote())    # retrieve the stored array\nprint(r)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]\n\n\n\n\nTo scale this to multiple workers, we can do the same with an array of workers:\nworkers = [ArrayStorage.remote() for i in range(2)]   # create two instances of the actor\n\nr = [workers[i].store_array.remote(np.ones(5)*(i+1)) for i in range(2)]\nprint(ray.get(r))\n\nprint(ray.get(workers[0].get_array.remote()))   # [1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]\nprint(ray.get(workers[1].get_array.remote()))   # [2. 2. 2. 2. 2.]\n\nr = [workers[i].get_array.remote() for i in range(2)]\nprint(ray.get(r))   # both arrays in one go\nIf we want to verify that these arrays stay on the same workers, we can retrieve and print their IDs and the node IDs by adding these two functions to the actor class:\n...\n    def get_actor_id(self):\n        return self.actor_id\n    def get_node_id(self):\n        return self.node_id   # the node ID where this actor is running\n...\nprint([ray.get(workers[i].get_actor_id.remote()) for i in range(2)])   # actor IDs\nprint([ray.get(workers[i].get_node_id.remote()) for i in range(2)])    # node IDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even use NumPy on workers. For example, if we were to implement a linear algebra solver on a worker and wanted to have the solution array stored there permanently, we could do it this way:\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\nray.init(num_cpus=2, configure_logging=False)\n\nn = 500\nh = 1/(n+1)\nb = np.exp(-(100*(np.linspace(0,1,n)-0.45))**2)*h*h\n\n@ray.remote\nclass ArrayStorage:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.b = None   # persistent variable\n        self.u = None   # persistent variable\n        flatIdentity = np.identity(n).reshape([n*n])\n        a = -2.0*flatIdentity\n        a[1:n*n-1] = a[1:n*n-1] + flatIdentity[:n*n-2] + flatIdentity[2:]\n        self.a = a.reshape([n,n])   # persistent variable\n    def store_b(self, arr):\n        self.b = arr                # store an array in the actor's state\n    def get_u(self):\n        return self.u\n    def localSolve(self):\n        self.u = np.linalg.solve(self.a,self.b)\n\nworker = ArrayStorage.remote(n)\nworker.store_b.remote(b)\nworker.localSolve.remote()\nu = ray.get(worker.get_u.remote())\nprint(\"The solution is\", u)\nFinally, you can delete a Ray actor with:\nray.kill(worker)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIs it possible to use JIT-compiled functions inside a Ray actor? The answer is “probably yes”: in Numba there is an experimental feature to compile Python classes with @jitclass. Whether you can use it to compile Ray classes is an open question – I’d be very interested to hear your findings on this."

    "text": "Ray Data\nRay Data is a parallel data processing library for ML workflows. As you will see in this section, Ray Data can be easily used for non-ML workflows. To process large datasets, Ray Data uses streaming/lazy execution, i.e. processing does not happen until you try to access (“consume” in Ray’s language) the result.\n\nThe core object in Ray Data is a dataset which is a distributed data collection. Ray datasets can store general multidimensional array data that are too large to fit into a single machine’s memory. In Ray Data, these large arrays will be:\n\ndistributed in memory across a number of Ray tasks and\nsaved to disk once they are no longer in use.\n\nRay’s dataset operates over a sequence of Ray object references to blocks. Each block contains a disjoint subset of rows, and Ray Data loads and transforms these blocks in parallel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey point\n\n\n\nEach row in Ray’s datasets is a dictionary (a collection of key-value pairs).\n\n\n\nCreating datasets\nimport ray\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\nds = ray.data.range(1000)   # create a dataset from a range\nds                # Dataset(num_rows=1000, schema={id: int64})\nds.count()        # explicitly count the number of rows; might be expensive (to load the dataset into memory)\nds.take(3)        # return first 3 rows as a list of dictionaries; default keys are often 'id' or 'item'\nlen(ds.take())    # default is 20 rows\nds.show(3)        # first 3 rows in a different format (one row per line)\nUntil recently, you could easily displays the number of blocks in a dataset, but now you have to materialize it first, and the number of blocks can change during execution:\nds.materialize().num_blocks()   # will show the number of blocks; might be expensive\nRows can be generated from arbitrary items:\nray.data.from_items([10,20,30]).take()   # [{'item': 10}, {'item': 20}, {'item': 30}]\nEach row is a dictionary, and dictionaries can have multiple key-value pairs:\nlistOfDict = [{\"col1\": i, \"col2\": i ** 2} for i in range(1000)] # each dict contains 2 pairs\nds = ray.data.from_items(listOfDict)\nds.show(5)\nA dataset can also be loaded from a file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis example works on my computer (pyenv activate env-hpc), but not on the training cluster where arrow/19.0.1 was compiled without S3 support.\n\n\ndd = ray.data.read_csv(\"s3://anonymous@air-example-data/iris.csv\")   # load a predefined dataset\ndd\ndd.show()   # might pause to read data, default is 20 rows\n\n\nTransforming datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay datasets become useful once you start processing them. Let’s initialize a simple dataset from a range:\nimport ray\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\nds = ray.data.range(1000)   # create a dataset\nds.show(5)\nWe will apply a function to each row in this dataset. This function must return a dictionary that will form each row in the new dataset:\na = ds.map(lambda row: {\"long\": str(row[\"id\"])*3})  # takes a row, returns a dict with 'id' values\n                                                    # converted to strings and repeated 3X\na          # it is a new dataset\na.show()\nWith .map() you can also use familiar non-lambda (i.e. non-anonymous) functions:\ndef squares(row):\n    return {'squares': row['id']**2}\n\nds.map(squares).show(5)\nYour function can also add new key-value pairs to the existing rows, instead of returning brand new rows:\nds = ray.data.range(1000)\ndef addSquares(row):\n    row['square'] = row['id']**2   # add a new entry to each row\n    return row                       \n\nb = ds.map(addSquares)\nds.show(5)  # original dataset\nb.show(5)   # contains both the original entries and the squares\nYou might have already noticed by now that all processing in Ray Data is lazy, i.e. it happens when we request results:\nds = ray.data.range(10_000_000)   # define a bigger dataset\nds.map(addSquares)   # no visible calculation, just a request, not consuming results\nds.map(addSquares).show()   # print results =&gt; start calculation\nds.map(addSquares).show()   # previous results were not stored, so this will re-run the calculation\n\nb = ds.map(addSquares)   # this does not start calculation\nb.show()                 # this starts calculation\nEvery time you print or use b, it’ll re-do the calculation. For this reason, you can think of b not as a variable with a value but as a data stream.\nHow can you do the calculation once and store the results for repeated use? You can convert b into a more permanent (not a data stream) object, e.g. a list:\nb = ds.map(addSquares)   # this does not start calculation\nc = b.take()             # create a list, fast (only first 20 elements)\nc = b.take(10_000_000)   # takes a couple of minutes, runs in parallel\nThis is not very efficient … certainly, computing 10,000,000 squares should not take a couple of minutes in parallel! The problem is that we have too many rows, and – similar to Python lists – Ray datasets perform poorly with too many rows. Think about subdividing your large computation into a number of chunks where each chunk comes with its own computational and communication overhead – you want to keep their number small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey point\n\n\n\nKeep the number of rows in a Ray dataset to a minimum.\n\n\nLet’s rewrite this problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 10_000_000\nn1 = n // 2\nn2 = n - n1\n\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\nds = ray.data.from_items([np.arange(n1), n1 + np.arange(n2)])\nds.show()   # 2 rows\n\ndef squares(row):\n    return {'squares': row['item']**2}   # compute element-wise square of an array\n\nstart = time()\nb = ds.map(squares).take()\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(b)\nNow the runtime is 0.072 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectorizable dataset transformations\nThe function .map_batches() will process batches (blocks) of rows, vectorizing operations on NumPy arrays inside each batch. We won’t study it here, as in practical terms it does not solve the specific problems in this course any faster. With .map_batches() you are limited in terms of data types that you can use inside a function passed to .map_batches() – in general it expects vectorizable NumPy arrays. If you are not planning to vectorize via map_batches(), use map() instead, and you will still get parallelization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow series with Ray Data\nLet’s start with a serial implementation:\nfrom time import time\nimport ray\nray.init(configure_logging=False)\n\nintervals = ray.data.from_items([{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 100_000_000}])   # one item\nintervals.show()\n\ndef slow(row):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(row['a'], row['b']+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    row['sum'] = total             # add key-value pair to the row\n    return row\n\nstart = time()\npartial = intervals.map(slow)      # define the calculation\ntotal = partial.take()[0]['sum']   # request the result =&gt; start the calculation on 1 CPU core\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nI get the average runtime of 6.978 seconds. To parallelize this, you can redefine intervals:\nintervals = ray.data.from_items([\n    {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 50_000_000},\n    {\"a\": 50_000_001, \"b\": 100_000_000},\n])\n\nstart = time()\npartial = intervals.map(slow)     # define the calculation\ntotal = sum([p['sum'] for p in partial.take()])   # request the result =&gt; start the calculation on 2 CPU cores\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))   # 4.322, 4.857, 4.782 and 3.852 3.812 3.823\nprint(total)\nOn 2 cores I get the average time of 3.765 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 14\n\n\n\n\n\nParallelize this for 4 CPU cores. Hint: programmatically form a list of dictionaries, each containing two key-value pairs (a and b) with the sub-intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn my laptop I am getting:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n6.978\n3.765\n1.675\n1.574\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing Ray datasets with Numba-compiled functions\nSo far we processed Ray datasets with non-Numba functions, either lambda (anonymous) or plain Python functions, and we obtained very good parallel scaling with multiple Ray processes. However, these functions are slower than their Numba-compiled versions.\nCan Ray Datasets be processed with Numba-compiled functions, similar to how we previously ran Numba-compiled functions on remote Ray workers? Absolutely yes. I will leave it to you to implement this for the slow series problem. I do have a working solution, but I am not sharing it here because it makes for an excellent take-home exercise.\nA couple of considerations:\n\nNumba does not work with Python dictionaries out of the box, instead providing its own dictionary type which is not compatible with Ray datasets. You can easily sidestep this problem, but you will have to find the solution yourself.\nVery important: you must do small runs on workers to copy your functions over to them – no need to time these runs. Without this “pre-compilation” step you will not get fast execution on workers on the bigger problem the first time you run it.\n\n\nWith this Numba-compiled processing, on my laptop I am getting:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n0.447\n0.234\n0.238\n0.137\n\n\n\nI am not quite sure why going 2 → 4 cores does not result in better runtimes, but there could be some inherent overhead in Ray tasks implementation on my laptop that shows up in this small problem – or more likely the efficiency cores enter the calculation at this time?\nWith the same code on the training cluster I get better scaling:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n1.054\n0.594\n0.306\n0.209"

    "text": "Running Ray workflows on multiple nodes\n\nTo run Ray workflows on multiple cluster nodes, you must create a virtual Ray cluster first. You can find details of Ray’s virtual clusters in the official Ray documentation.\nHere we take a look at the example which I copied and adapted from our wiki documentation at https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Ray. We make several changes in this workflow:\n\nmake it interactive,\ndo not create virtual environments in $SLURM_TMPDIR inside the job, but load the existing one from /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-hpc,\nremove GPUs.\n\nLet’s quit our current Slurm job (if any), back on the login node start the following interactive job, and then run the following commands:\nmodule load python/3.12.4 arrow/19.0.1 scipy-stack/2025a netcdf/4.9.2\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-hpc/bin/activate\n\nsalloc --nodes 2 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --time=0:60:0\n\nexport HEAD_NODE=$(hostname)   # head node's address -- different from the login node!\nexport RAY_PORT=34567          # a port to start Ray on the head node \nNext, we will start a Ray cluster on the head node as a background process:\nray start --head --node-ip-address=$HEAD_NODE --port=$RAY_PORT --num-cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --block &\nsleep 10   # wait for the prompt; it'll ask to enable usage stats collection\n...\n# Eventually should say \"Ray runtime started.\"\nThen on each compute node inside our Slurm job, except the head node, we launch the worker nodes of the Ray cluster:\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; launchRay.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nmodule load python/3.12.4 arrow/19.0.1 scipy-stack/2025a netcdf/4.9.2\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-hpc/bin/activate\nif [[ \"\\$SLURM_PROCID\" -eq \"0\" ]]; then   # if MPI rank is 0\n        echo \"Ray head node already started...\"\n        sleep 10\nelse\n        ray start --address \"${HEAD_NODE}:${RAY_PORT}\" --num-cpus=\"${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}\" --block\n        sleep 5\n        echo \"Ray worker started!\"\nfi\nEOF\nchmod u+x launchRay.sh\nsrun launchRay.sh &\nray_cluster_pid=$!   # get its process ID\nNext, we launch a Python script that connects to the Ray cluster, checks the nodes and all available CPUs:\nimport ray\nimport os\nray.init(address=f\"{os.environ['HEAD_NODE']}:{os.environ['RAY_PORT']}\",_node_ip_address=os.environ['HEAD_NODE'])\n...\n# Eventually should say \"Connected to Ray cluster.\"\nprint(\"Nodes in the Ray cluster:\", ray.nodes())   # should see two nodes with 'Alive' status\nprint(ray.available_resources())                  # should see 4 CPUs and 2 nodes\nFinally, from bash, we shut down the Ray worker nodes:\nkill $ray_cluster_pid\nand terminate the job."

Ray writes (“spills”) objects to storage once they are no longer in use, as it tries to minimize the total number of “materialized” (in-memory) blocks. On Linux and MacOS, the temporary spill folder is /tmp/ray, but you can customize its location as described here.\nWith the automatic object spilling to disk disabled (our second flag to ray.init() above), these arrays will stay in memory.\nWith that flag removed, and hence with the usual automatic object spilling to disk, these array blocks will be automatically written to disk, and the memory usage goes back to zero after a fraction of a second. If next you try to access these arrays, e.g.\nd = c.take()\ntype(d[0]['array'])   # numpy.ndarray\nd[0]['array'].shape   # (800, 800, 800)\nthey will be loaded temporarily into memory, which you can monitor with htop --filter \"ray::IDLE\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPandas on Ray (Modin)\nYou can run many types of I/O workflows on top of Ray. One famous example is “Modin” (previously called Pandas on Ray) which is a drop-in replacement for Pandas on top of Ray. We won’t study here, but it will run all your pandas workflows, and you don’t need to modify your code, except importing the library, e.g.\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"filename.csv\", &lt;other flags&gt;)\nwill become\nimport modin.pandas as pd\nimport ray\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"filename.csv\", &lt;other flags&gt;)\nModin will run your workflows using Ray tasks on multiple cores, potentially speeding up large workflows. You can find more information at https://github.com/modin-project/modin.\nSimilarly, many other Ray Data read functions will read your data in parallel, distributing it to multiple processes if necessary for larger processing:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import ray\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ray.data.read_\nray.data.read_api                 ray.data.read_databricks_tables(  ray.data.read_mongo(              ray.data.read_sql(\nray.data.read_bigquery(           ray.data.read_datasource(         ray.data.read_numpy(              ray.data.read_text(\nray.data.read_binary_files(       ray.data.read_images(             ray.data.read_parquet(            ray.data.read_tfrecords(\nray.data.read_csv(                ray.data.read_json(               ray.data.read_parquet_bulk(       ray.data.read_webdataset(\n\n\n\n\nProcessing images\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis example won’t work on the training cluster, where arrow/19.0.1 was compiled without proper filesystem support. However, I can demo this on my computer.\n\n\nHere is a simple example of processing a directory with images with Ray Data. Suppose we have a \\(2874\\times\n2154\\) image tuscany.avif. Let’s crop 100 random \\(300\\times 300\\) images out of it:\ntmpdir=${RANDOM}${RANDOM}\nmkdir -p ~/$tmpdir && cd ~/$tmpdir\npyenv activate env-hpc\n\nwget https://wgpages.netlify.app/img/tuscany.jpg\nls -l tuscany.jpg\nmkdir -p images\nwidth=$(identify tuscany.jpg | awk '{print $3}' | awk -Fx '{print $1}')\nheight=$(identify tuscany.jpg | awk '{print $3}' | awk -Fx '{print $2}')\n\nfor num in $(seq -w 00 99); do   # crop it into hundred 300x300 random images\n    echo $num\n    x=$(echo \"scale=8; $RANDOM / 32767 * ($width-300)\" | bc)   # $RANDOM goes from 0 to 32767\n    x=$(echo $x | awk '{print int($1+0.5)}')\n    y=$(echo \"scale=8; $RANDOM / 32767 * ($height-300)\" | bc)\n    y=$(echo $y | awk '{print int($1+0.5)}')\n    convert tuscany.jpg -crop 300x300+$x+$y images/small$num.png\ndone\nNow we will load these images into Ray Data. First, let’s set export RAY_DEDUP_LOGS=0, and then do:\nimport ray\nds = ray.data.read_images(\"images/\")\nds   # 100 rows (one image per row) split into ... blocks\nds.take(1)[0]                  # first image\ntype(ds.take(1)[0][\"image\"])   # stored as a numpy array\nds.take(1)[0][\"image\"].shape   # 300x300 and three channels (RGB)\nds.take(1)[0][\"image\"].max()   # 255 =&gt; they are stored as 8-bit images (0..255)\nLet’s print min/max values for all images:\ndef minmax(row):\n    print(row[\"image\"].min(), row[\"image\"].max())\n    return row  # must return a dictionary, otherwise `map` will fail\n\nb = ds.map(minmax)   # on output; we scheduled the calculation, but have not started it yet\nb.materialize()      # force the calculation =&gt; now we see printouts from individual rows\nLet’s compute their negatives:\ndef negate(row):\n    return {'image': 255-row['image']}\n\nnegative = ds.map(negate)\nnegative.write_images(\"output\", column='image')\nIn output/ subdirectory you will find 100 negative images.\n\n\nCoding parallel I/O by hand\nIn Ray Data you can also write your own parallel I/O workflows by hand, defining functions to process rows that will load certain data/file into a specific row, e.g. with something like this:\na = ray.data.from_items([\n    {'file': '/path/to/file1'},\n    {'file': '/path/to/file2'},\n    {'file': '/path/to/file3'}\n])\ndef readFileInParallel(row):\n    &lt;load data from file row['file']&gt;\n    &lt;process these data&gt;\n    row['status'] = 'done'\n    return row\n\nb = a.map(readFileInParallel)\nb.show()\n\n\nA CPU-intensive problem without reduction\nSo far we’ve been working with problems where calculations from individual tasks add to form a single number (sum of a slow series) – this is called reduction. Let’s now look at a problem without reduction, i.e. where results stay distributed.\nLet’s compute a mathematical Julia set defined as a set of points on the complex plane that remain bound under an infinite recursive transformation \\(z_{i+1}=f(z_i)\\). For the recursive function, we will use the traditional form \\(f(z)=z^2+c\\), where \\(c\\) is a complex constant. Here is our algorithm:\n\npick a point \\(z_0\\in\\mathbb{C}\\)\ncompute iterations \\(z_{i+1}=z_i^2+c\\) until \\(|z_i|&gt;4\\) (arbitrary fixed radius; here \\(c\\) is a complex constant)\nstore the iteration number \\(\\xi(z_0)\\) at which \\(z_i\\) reaches the circle \\(|z|=4\\)\nlimit max iterations at 255\n4.1 if \\(\\xi(z_0)\\lt 255\\), then \\(z_0\\) is a stable point\n4.2 the quicker a point diverges, the lower its \\(\\xi(z_0)\\) is\nplot \\(\\xi(z_0)\\) for all \\(z_0\\) in a rectangular region   \\(-1.2&lt;=\\mathfrak{Re}(z_0)&lt;=1.2\\)   and   \\(-1.2&lt;=\\mathfrak{Im}(z_0)&lt;=1.2\\)\n\nWe should get something conceptually similar to this figure (here \\(c = 0.355 + 0.355i\\); we’ll get drastically different fractals for different values of \\(c\\)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might want to try these values too:\n\\(c = 1.2e^{1.1πi}\\) \\(~\\Rightarrow~\\) original textbook example\n\\(c = -0.4-0.59i\\) and 1.5X zoom-out \\(~\\Rightarrow~\\) denser spirals\n\\(c = 1.34-0.45i\\) and 1.8X zoom-out \\(~\\Rightarrow~\\) beans\n\\(c = 0.34-0.05i\\) and 1.2X zoom-out \\(~\\Rightarrow~\\) connected spiral boots\n\n\nAs you must be accustomed by now, this calculation runs much faster when implemented in a compiled language. I tried Julia (0.676s) and Chapel (0.489s), in both cases running the code on my laptop in serial (one CPU core), both with exactly the same workflow and the same \\(2000^2\\) image size.\nBelow is the serial implementation in Python – let’s save it as juliaSetSerial.py:\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\n\nnx = ny = 2000   # image size\n\ndef pixel(z):\n    c = 0.355 + 0.355j\n    for i in range(1, 256):\n        z = z**2 + c\n        if abs(z) &gt;= 4:\n            return i\n    return 255\n\nprint(\"Computing Julia set ...\")\nstability = np.zeros((nx,ny), dtype=np.int32)\n\nstart = time()\nfor i in range(nx):\n    for k in range(ny):\n        point = 1.2*((2*(i+0.5)/nx-1) + (2*(k+0.5)/ny-1)*1j) # rescale to -1.2:1.2 in the complex plane\n        stability[i,k] = pixel(point)\n\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\n\nimport netCDF4 as nc\nf = nc.Dataset('test.nc', 'w', format='NETCDF4')\nf.createDimension('x', nx)\nf.createDimension('y', ny)\noutput = f.createVariable('stability', 'i4', ('x', 'y'))   # 4-byte integer\noutput[:,:] = stability\nf.close()\nHere we are timing purely the computational part, not saving the image to a NetCDF file. Let’s run it and look at the result in ParaView! When running this on my laptop, it takes 9.220 seconds.\nHow would you parallelize this problem with ray.data? The main points to remember are:\n\nYou need to subdivide your problem into blocks – let’s do this in the ny (vertical) dimension.\nYou have to construct a dataset with each row containing inputs for a single task. These inputs will be the size of each image block and the offset (the starting row number of this block inside the image).\nYou need to write a function computeStability(row) that acts on each input row in the dataset. The result will be a NumPy array stored as a new entry stability in each row.\nTo write the final image to a NetCDF file, you need to merge these arrays into a single \\(2000\\times 2000\\) array, and then write this square array to disk.\n\nThe solution is in the file juliaSetParallel.py on instructor’s laptop. Here are the runtimes for \\(2000\\times 2000\\) (averaged over three runs):\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n9.220\n4.869\n2.846\n2.210"

    "text": "Scatter plots\nAt the very beginning of this workshop we saw an example of a Scatter plot with Graph Objects:\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom numpy import linspace, sin\nx = linspace(0.01,1,100)\ny = sin(1/x)\nline = go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='lines+markers', name='sin(1/x)')\ngo.Figure([line])\nLet’s print the dataset line:\ntype(line)    # plotly.graph_objs._scatter.Scatter\nprint(line)   # it's a dictionary!\nline['name']   # returns a string\nline['x']      # returns a numpy array\nIt is a plotly object which is actually a Python dictionary underneath, with all elements clearly identified (plot type, x NumPy array, y NumPy array, line type, legend line name). So, go.Scatter simply creates a dictionary with the corresponding type element. Right now, this variable line completely describes our plot! To create a plot in Graph Objects, we pass a list of such objects to a plotting function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTraces\n\n\n\nIn Plotly, these objects are called traces, and they are a fundamental building block of a plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHovering with a mouse\n\n\n\nHovering over each data point will reveal their coordinates. Use the toolbar at the top. When zooming in/out, double-clicking on the plot will reset it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 1: two traces\n\n\n\n\n\nPass a list of two traces to the plotting routine with data = [line1,line2]. Let the second trace line2 contain another mathematical function. The idea is to have multiple objects in the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 2: add dots\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a bunch of dots to the plot with dots = go.Scatter(x=[.2,.4,.6,.8], y=[2,1.5,2,1.2]). What is default scatter mode?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 3: style the dots\n\n\n\n\n\nChange line colour and width by adding the dictionary line=dict(color=('rgb(10,205,24)'),width=4) to dots. Make the colour yellow – there are two ways to do this: via RGB and by passing a string. Now make the line markers green.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise 4: random filled circles\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a scatter plot of 300 random filled blue circles inside a unit square. Their random opacity must anti-correlate with their size (bigger circles should be more transparent) – see the plot below. \n\n\n\nFor more precise customization, try updating a layout after creating the figure:\nfig = go.Figure(...)\nfig.update_layout(xaxis=dict(tickfont=dict(size=24), range=[0, 1]),\n                  yaxis=dict(tickfont=dict(size=24), range=[0, 1]))\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUpdating layout\n\n\n\nYou can use fig.update_layout with both Graph Objects and Plotly Express, as both create the same type of object.",

For the former you’ll need to install Plotly Cloud extension with uv pip install \"dash[cloud]\" (exact command depends on your Python setup) and then start the app with app.run(debug=True) and use the dev tools UI in the lower right corner. To replace your currently running app (there is a limit of 1) you need to open the app settings, or click Open Settings in Plotly Cloud | General | Delete Dash app, and only then you can publish a new app.\nI personally find it easiest to use their web UI and drag and drop my Dash *.py script files. Also note that – when publishing to Plotly Cloud – it appears it won’t run the community styling libraries: I tried Dash Bootstrap Components and saw no formatting.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Important: In a shorter Chapel course, we suggest skipping this section and focus mostly on data parallelism, coming back here only when you have time.\nHere is our plan to task-parallelize the heat transfer equation:\n\ndivide the entire grid of points into blocks and assign blocks to individual tasks,\neach task should compute the new temperature of its assigned points,\nperform a reduction over the whole grid, to update the greatest temperature difference between Tnew and T.\n\nFor the reduction of the grid we can simply use the max reduce statement, which is already parallelized. Now, let’s divide the grid into rowtasks * coltasks subgrids, and assign each subgrid to a task using the coforall loop (we will have rowtasks * coltasks tasks in total).\nRecall out code gmax.chpl in which we broke the 1D array with 1e8 elements into numtasks=2 blocks, and each task was processing elements start..finish. Now we’ll do exactly the same in 2D. First, let’s write a quick serial code test.chpl to test the indices:\nconfig const rows, cols = 100;               // number of rows and columns in our matrix\n\nconfig const rowtasks = 3, coltasks = 4; // number of blocks in x- and y-dimensions\n// each block processed by a separate task\n// let's pretend we have 12 cores\n\nconst nr = rows / rowtasks;   // number of rows per task\nconst rr = rows % rowtasks;   // remainder rows (did not fit into the last row of tasks)\nconst nc = cols / coltasks;   // number of columns per task\nconst rc = cols % coltasks;   // remainder columns (did not fit into the last column of tasks)\n\ncoforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 {\n  var row1, row2, col1, col2: int;\n  row1 = taskid/coltasks*nr + 1;\n  row2 = taskid/coltasks*nr + nr;\n  if row2 == rowtasks*nr then row2 += rr; // add rr rows to the last row of tasks\n  col1 = taskid%coltasks*nc + 1;\n  col2 = taskid%coltasks*nc + nc;\n  if col2 == coltasks*nc then col2 += rc; // add rc columns to the last column of tasks\n  writeln('task ', taskid, ': rows ', row1, '-', row2, ' and columns ', col1, '-', col2);\n}\n$ chpl test.chpl -o test\n$ sed -i -e 's|atomic|test|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\ntask 0: rows 1-33 and columns 1-25\ntask 1: rows 1-33 and columns 26-50\ntask 2: rows 1-33 and columns 51-75\ntask 3: rows 1-33 and columns 76-100\ntask 4: rows 34-66 and columns 1-25\ntask 5: rows 34-66 and columns 26-50\ntask 6: rows 34-66 and columns 51-75\ntask 7: rows 34-66 and columns 76-100\ntask 8: rows 67-100 and columns 1-25\ntask 9: rows 67-100 and columns 26-50\ntask 10: rows 67-100 and columns 51-75\ntask 11: rows 67-100 and columns 76-100\nAs you can see, dividing Tnew computation between concurrent tasks could be cumbersome. Chapel provides high-level abstractions for data parallelism that take care of all the data distribution for us. We will study data parallelism in the following lessons, but for now let’s compare the benchmark solution (baseSolver.chpl) with our coforall parallelization to see how the performance improved.\nNow we’ll parallelize our heat transfer solver. Let’s copy baseSolver.chpl into parallel1.chpl and then start editing the latter. We’ll make the following changes in parallel1.chpl:\ndiff baseSolver.chpl parallel1.chpl\n18a19,24\n&gt; config const rowtasks = 3, coltasks = 4;   // let's pretend we have 12 cores\n&gt; const nr = rows / rowtasks;    // number of rows per task\n&gt; const rr = rows - nr*rowtasks; // remainder rows (did not fit into the last task)\n&gt; const nc = cols / coltasks;    // number of columns per task\n&gt; const rc = cols - nc*coltasks; // remainder columns (did not fit into the last task)\n&gt;\n31,32c37,46\n&lt;   for i in 1..rows {    // do smth for row i\n&lt;     for j in 1..cols {  // do smth for row i and column j\n&lt;       Tnew[i,j] = 0.25 * (T[i-1,j] + T[i+1,j] + T[i,j-1] + T[i,j+1]);\n&lt;     }\n&lt;   }\n---\n&gt;   coforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 { // each iteration processed by a separate task\n&gt;     var row1, row2, col1, col2: int;\n&gt;     row1 = taskid/coltasks*nr + 1;\n&gt;     row2 = taskid/coltasks*nr + nr;\n&gt;     if row2 == rowtasks*nr then row2 += rr; // add rr rows to the last row of tasks\n&gt;     col1 = taskid%coltasks*nc + 1;\n&gt;     col2 = taskid%coltasks*nc + nc;\n&gt;     if col2 == coltasks*nc then col2 += rc; // add rc columns to the last column of tasks\n&gt;     for i in row1..row2 {\n&gt;       for j in col1..col2 {\n&gt;         Tnew[i,j] = 0.25 * (T[i-1,j] + T[i+1,j] + T[i,j-1] + T[i,j+1]);\n&gt;       }\n&gt;     }\n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n36,42d49\n&lt;   delta = 0;\n&lt;   for i in 1..rows {\n&lt;     for j in 1..cols {\n&lt;       tmp = abs(Tnew[i,j]-T[i,j]);\n&lt;       if tmp &gt; delta then delta = tmp;\n&lt;     }\n&lt;   }\n43a51,52\n&gt;   delta = max reduce abs(Tnew[1..rows,1..cols]-T[1..rows,1..cols]);\nLet’s compile and run both codes on the same large problem:\n$ chpl --fast baseSolver.chpl -o baseSolver\n$ sed -i -e 's|test|baseSolver --rows=650 --iout=200 --niter=10_000 --tolerance=0.002 --nout=1000|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nWorking with a matrix 650x650 to 10000 iterations or dT below 0.002\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 1000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 2000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 3000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 4000: 24.9998\nTemperature at iteration 5000: 24.9984\nTemperature at iteration 6000: 24.9935\nTemperature at iteration 7000: 24.9819\nFinal temperature at the desired position [200,300] after 7750 iterations is: 24.9671\nThe largest temperature difference was 0.00199985\nThe simulation took 8.96548 seconds\n\n$ chpl --fast parallel1.chpl -o parallel1\n$ sed -i -e 's|baseSolver|parallel1|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nWorking with a matrix 650x650 to 10000 iterations or dT below 0.002\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 1000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 2000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 3000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 4000: 24.9998\nTemperature at iteration 5000: 24.9984\nTemperature at iteration 6000: 24.9935\nTemperature at iteration 7000: 24.9819\nFinal temperature at the desired position [200,300] after 7750 iterations is: 24.9671\nThe largest temperature difference was 0.00199985\nThe simulation took 25.106 seconds\nBoth ran to 7750 iterations, with the same numerical results, but the parallel code is nearly 3X slower – that’s terrible!\n\nDiscussion\nWhat happened!?…\n\nTo understand the reason, let’s analyze the code. When the program starts, the main task does all the declarations and initializations, and then, it enters the main loop of the simulation (the while loop). Inside this loop, the parallel tasks are launched for the first time. When these tasks finish their computations, the main task resumes its execution, it updates delta and T, and everything is repeated again. So, in essence, parallel tasks are launched and terminated 7750 times, which introduces a significant amount of overhead (the time the system needs to effectively start and destroy tasks in the specific hardware, at each iteration of the while loop).\nClearly, a better approach would be to launch the parallel tasks just once, and have them execute all the time steps, before resuming the main task to print the final results.\nLet’s copy parallel1.chpl into parallel2.chpl and then start editing the latter. We’ll make the following changes:\n\nMove the rows\n\n  coforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 { // each iteration processed by a separate task\n    var row1, row2, col1, col2: int;\n    row1 = taskid/coltasks*nr + 1;\n    row2 = taskid/coltasks*nr + nr;\n    if row2 == rowtasks*nr then row2 += rr; // add rr rows to the last row of tasks\n    col1 = taskid%coltasks*nc + 1;\n    col2 = taskid%coltasks*nc + nc;\n    if col2 == coltasks*nc then col2 += rc; // add rc columns to the last column of tasks\nand the corresponding closing bracket } of this coforall loop outside the while loop, so that while is now nested inside coforall.\n\nSince now copying Tnew into T is a local operation for each task, i.e. we should replace T = Tnew; with\n\nT[row1..row2,col1..col2] = Tnew[row1..row2,col1..col2];\nBut this is not sufficient! We need to make sure we finish computing all elements of Tnew in all tasks before computing the greatest temperature difference delta. For that we need to synchronize all tasks, right after computing Tnew. We’ll also need to synchronize tasks after computing delta and T from Tnew, as none of the tasks should jump into the new iteration without having delta and T! So, we need two synchronization points inside the coforall loop.\n\n\n\n\nDefine two atomic variables that we’ll use for synchronization\n\nvar lock1, lock2: atomic int;\nand add after the (i,j)-loops to compute Tnew the following:\nlock1.add(1);   // each task atomically adds 1 to lock\nlock1.waitFor(coltasks*rowtasks*count);   // then it waits for lock to be equal coltasks*rowtasks\nand after T[row1..row2,col1..col2] = Tnew[row1..row2,col1..col2]; the following:\nlock2.add(1);   // each task atomically subtracts 1 from lock\nlock2.waitFor(coltasks*rowtasks*count);   // then it waits for lock to be equal 0\nNotice that we have a product coltasks*rowtasks*count, since lock1/lock2 will be incremented by all tasks at all iterations.\n\nMove var count = 0: int; into coforall so that it becomes a local variable for each task. Also, remove count instance (in writeln()) after coforall ends.\nMake delta atomic:\n\nvar delta: atomic real;    // the greatest temperature difference between Tnew and T\n...\ndelta.write(tolerance*10); // some safe initial large value\n...\nwhile (count &lt; niter && delta.read() &gt;= tolerance) {\n\nDefine an array of local delta’s for each task and use it to compute delta:\n\nvar arrayDelta: [0..coltasks*rowtasks-1] real;\n...\nvar tmp: real;  // inside coforall\n...\ntmp = 0;        // inside while\n...\ntmp = max(abs(Tnew[i,j]-T[i,j]),tmp);    // next line after Tnew[i,j] = ...\n...\narrayDelta[taskid] = tmp;   // right after (i,j)-loop to compute Tnew[i,j]\n...\nif taskid == 0 then {       // compute delta right after lock1.waitFor()\n    delta.write(max reduce arrayDelta);\n    if count%nout == 0 then writeln('Temperature at iteration ', count, ': ', Tnew[iout,jout]);\n}\n\nRemove the original T[iout,jout] output line.\nFinally, move the boundary conditions (right+bottom edges) before the while loop. Why can we do it now?\n\nNow let’s compare the performance of parallel2.chpl to the benchmark serial solution baseSolver.chpl:\n$ sed -i -e 's|parallel1|baseSolver|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nWorking with a matrix 650x650 to 10000 iterations or dT below 0.002\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 1000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 2000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 3000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 4000: 24.9998\nTemperature at iteration 5000: 24.9984\nTemperature at iteration 6000: 24.9935\nTemperature at iteration 7000: 24.9819\nFinal temperature at the desired position [200,300] after 7750 iterations is: 24.9671\nThe largest temperature difference was 0.00199985\nThe simulation took 9.40637 seconds\n\n$ chpl --fast parallel2.chpl -o parallel2\n$ sed -i -e 's|baseSolver|parallel2|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nWorking with a matrix 650x650 to 10000 iterations or dT below 0.002\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 1000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 2000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 3000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 4000: 24.9998\nTemperature at iteration 5000: 24.9984\nTemperature at iteration 6000: 24.9935\nTemperature at iteration 7000: 24.9819\nFinal temperature at the desired position [200,300] is: 24.9671\nThe largest temperature difference was 0.00199985\nThe simulation took 4.74536 seconds\nWe get a speedup of 2X on two cores, as we should.\nFinally, here is a parallel scaling test on Cedar inside a 32-core interactive job:\n$ ./parallel2 ... --rowtasks=1 --coltasks=1\nThe simulation took 32.2201 seconds\n\n$ ./parallel2 ... --rowtasks=2 --coltasks=2\nThe simulation took 10.197 seconds\n\n$ ./parallel2 ... --rowtasks=4 --coltasks=4\nThe simulation took 3.79577 seconds\n\n$ ./parallel2 ... --rowtasks=4 --coltasks=8\nThe simulation took 2.4874 seconds",

When a variable is declared as sync, a state that can be full or empty is associated with it.\nTo assign a new value to a sync variable, its state must be empty (after the assignment operation is completed, the state will be set as full). On the contrary, to read a value from a sync variable, its state must be full (after the read operation is completed, the state will be set as empty again).\nvar x: sync int;\nwriteln('this is the main task launching a new task');\nbegin {\n  for i in 1..10 do\n    writeln('this is the new task working: ', i);\n  x.writeEF(2);   // write the value, state changes from Empty to Full\n  writeln('New task finished');\n}\nwriteln('this is the main task after launching new task ... I will wait until x is full');\nx.readFE();         // read the value, state changes from Full to Empty\nwriteln('and now it is done');\n$ chpl sync2.chpl -o sync2\n$ sed -i -e 's|sync1|sync2|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nthis is main task launching a new task\nthis is main task after launching new task ... I will wait until x is full\nthis is new task working: 1\nthis is new task working: 2\nthis is new task working: 3\nthis is new task working: 4\nthis is new task working: 5\nthis is new task working: 6\nthis is new task working: 7\nthis is new task working: 8\nthis is new task working: 9\nthis is new task working: 10\nNew task finished\nand now it is done\nHere the main task does not continue until the variable is full and can be read.\n\nLet’s add another line x.readFE(); – now it is stuck since we cannot read x while it’s empty!\nLet’s add x.writeEF(5); right before the last x.readFE(); – now we set is to full again (and assigned 5), and it can be read again.\n\nThere are a number of methods defined for sync variables. Suppose x is a sync variable of a given type:\n// general methods\nx.reset() - set the state as empty and the value as the default of x's type\nx.isfull() - return true is the state of x is full, false if it is empty\n\n// blocking read and write methods\nx.writeEF(value) - block until the state of x is empty, then assign the value and\n                   set the state to full\nx.writeFF(value) - block until the state of x is full, then assign the value and\n                   leave the state as full\nx.readFE() - block until the state of x is full, then return x's value and set\n             the state to empty\nx.readFF() - block until the state of x is full, then return x's value and\n             leave the state as full\n\n// non-blocking read and write methods\nx.writeXF(value) - assign the value no matter the state of x, then set the state as full\nx.readXX() - return the value of x regardless its state; the state will remain unchanged\n\n\nAtomic variables\nChapel also implements atomic operations with variables declared as atomic, and this provides another option to synchronize tasks. Atomic operations run completely independently of any other task or process. This means that when several tasks try to write an atomic variable, only one will succeed at a given moment, providing implicit synchronization between them. There is a number of methods defined for atomic variables, among them sub(), add(), write(), read(), and waitfor() are very useful to establish explicit synchronization between tasks, as shown in the next code atomic.chpl:\nvar lock: atomic int;\nconst numtasks = 5;\n\nlock.write(0);               // the main task set lock to zero\n\ncoforall id in 1..numtasks {\n  writeln('greetings form task ', id, '... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello');\n  lock.add(1);               // task id says hello and atomically adds 1 to lock\n  lock.waitFor(numtasks);  // then it waits for lock to be equal numtasks (which will happen when all tasks say hello)\n  writeln('task ', id, ' is done ...');\n}\n$ chpl atomic.chpl -o atomic\n$ sed -i -e 's|sync2|atomic|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\ngreetings form task 4... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello\ngreetings form task 5... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello\ngreetings form task 2... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello\ngreetings form task 3... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello\ngreetings form task 1... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello\ntask 1 is done...\ntask 5 is done...\ntask 2 is done...\ntask 3 is done...\ntask 4 is done...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nComment out the line lock.waitfor(numtasks) in the code above to clearly observe the effect of task synchronization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Task.4\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to add another synchronization point right after the last writeln() command. What is wrong with adding the following at the end of the coforall loop?\n  lock.sub(1);      // task id says hello and atomically subtracts 1 from lock\n  lock.waitFor(0);  // then it waits for lock to be equal 0 (which will happen when all tasks say hello)\n  writeln('task ', id, ' is really done ...');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Task.5\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, then what is the solution if we want two synchronization points?\n\n\n\nFinally, with everything learned so far, we should be ready to parallelize our code for the simulation of the heat transfer equation.",

When a variable declared as const is initialized, its value cannot be modified anymore during the execution of the program.\nTo declare a variable, we must either (1) specify its type or (2) initialize it in place with some value from which the compiler will infer its type. The common variable types in Chapel are:\n\ninteger int – defaults to int(64), or you can explicitly specify int(32),\nfloating point number real – defaults to real(64), or you can explicitly specify real(32),\nboolean bool,\nstring string\n\nIf a variable is declared without a type, Chapel will infer it from the given initial value, for example (let’s store this in juliaSetSerial.chpl):\n\nconst n = 2_000;   // vertical and horizontal size of our image\nAll these constant variables will be created as integers, and no other values can be assigned to these variables during the execution of the program.\nOn the other hand, if a variable is declared without an initial value, Chapel will initialize it with a default value depending on the declared type:\nvar y: real;        // vertical coordinate in our plot; real(64) variable set to 0.0\nvar point: complex; // current point in our image; complex(64) variable set to 0.0+0.0*1i\nOf course, we can use both, the initial value and the type, when declaring a varible as follows:\nconst c: complex = 0.355 + 0.355i;   // Julia set constant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe following two notations are different, but produce the same result in the end:\nvar a: real = 10;   // we specify both the type and the value\nvar a = 10: real;   // we specify only the value (integer 10 converted to real)\n\n\nLet’s print our configuration after we set all parameters:\nwriteln('Computing ', n, 'x', n, ' Julia set ...');\nAlternatively, you can use formatted output:\nwritef(\"Computing %ix%i Julia set\\n\", n, n);\nFor other format specifiers, check the table at https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/IO/FormattedIO.html\n\nPrinting variable’s type\nTo check a variable’s type, use .type query:\nvar x = 1e8:int;\ntype t = x.type;\nwriteln(t:string);\nor in a single line:\nwriteln((1e8:int).type:string);\nwriteln((0.355 + 0.355i).type: string);",

Shouldn’t the parallel code run ~8X faster, since we have 8X as many processors?\nThis is a fine-grained parallel code that needs a lot of communication between tasks, and relatively little computing. So, we are seeing the communication overhead. The training cluster has a very slow interconnect, so the problem is even worse there than on a production cluster!\nIf we increase our 2D problem size, there will be more computation (scaling as \\(O(n^2)\\)) in between communications (scaling as \\(O(n)\\)), and at some point the parallel code should catch up to the serial code and eventually run faster. Let’s try these problem sizes:\n--rows=650 --cols=650 --niter=9500 --tolerance=0.002\nLargest temperature difference was 0.0019989\nConverged after 7766 iterations\n\n--rows=2000 --cols=2000 --niter=9500 --tolerance=0.002\nLargest temperature difference was 0.0019989\nConverged after 9158 iterations\n\n--rows=8000 --cols=8000 --niter=9800 --tolerance=0.002\nLargest temperature difference was 0.0019989\nConverged after 9725 iterations\n\n--rows=16000 --cols=16000 --niter=9900 --tolerance=0.002\nLargest temperature difference was 0.0019989\nConverged after 9847 iterations\n\nOn the training cluster (slower interconnect)\nI switched both codes to single precision (change real to real(32) and use (80.0*i/rows):real(32) when assigning to real(32) variables), to be able to accommodate larger arrays.

    "text": "Let’s now talk about task parallelism. This is a lower-level style of programming, in which you explicitly tell Chapel how to subdivide your computation into tasks. As this is more human-labour intensive than data parallelism, here we will only outline the main concepts and pitfalls, without going into too much detail.\nA Chapel program always starts as a single main task (and here we use the term “task” loosely as it could be a thread). You can then start concurrent tasks with the begin statement. A task spawned by the begin statement will run in a different task while the main task continues its normal execution. Let’s start a new code begin.chpl with the following lines:\nvar x = 100;\nwriteln('This is the main task starting first task');\nbegin {\n  var count = 0;\n  while count &lt; 10 {\n    count += 1;\n    writeln('task 1: ', x + count);\n  }\n}\nwriteln('This is the main task starting second task');\nbegin {\n  var count = 0;\n  while count &lt; 10 {\n    count += 1;\n    writeln('task 2: ', x + count);\n  }\n}\nwriteln('This is the main task, I am done ...');\n$ chpl begin.chpl -o begin\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nThis is the main task starting first task\nThis is the main task starting second task\nThis is the main task, I am done ...\ntask 2: 101\ntask 1: 101\ntask 2: 102\ntask 1: 102\ntask 2: 103\ntask 1: 103\ntask 2: 104\n...\ntask 1: 109\ntask 2: 109\ntask 1: 110\ntask 2: 110\nAs you can see the order of the output is not what we would expected, and actually it is somewhat unpredictable. This is a well known effect of concurrent tasks accessing the same shared resource at the same time (in this case the screen); the system decides in which order the tasks could write to the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if in the last code we move the definition of count into the main task, but try to assign it from tasks 1 and 2?\n\nAnswer: we’ll get an error at compilation (“cannot assign to const variable”), since then count would belong to the main task (would be defined within the scope of the main task), and we could modify its value only in the main task.\n\nWhat would happen if we try to insert a second definition var x = 10; inside the first begin statement?\n\nAnswer: that will actually work, as we’ll simply create another, local instance of x with its own value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey idea\n\n\n\nAll variables have a scope in which they can be used. Variables declared inside a concurrent task are accessible only by that task. Variables declared in the main task can be read everywhere, but Chapel won’t allow other concurrent tasks to modify them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the concurrent tasks, spawned by the last code, running truly in parallel?\nAnswer: it depends on the number of cores available to your job. If you have a single core, they’ll run concurrently, with the CPU switching between the tasks. If you have two cores, task1 and task2 will likely run in parallel using the two cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey idea\n\n\n\nTo maximize performance, start as many tasks (threads) as the number of available cores.\n\n\nA slightly more structured way to start concurrent tasks in Chapel is by using the cobegin statement. Here you can start a block of concurrent tasks, one for each statement inside the curly brackets. Another difference between the begin and cobegin statements is that with the cobegin, all the spawned tasks are synchronized at the end of the statement, i.e. the main task won’t continue its execution until all tasks are done. Let’s start cobegin.chpl:\nvar x = 0;\nwriteln('This is the main task, my value of x is ', x);\ncobegin {\n  {\n    var x = 5;\n    writeln('This is task 1, my value of x is ', x);\n  }\n  writeln('This is task 2, my value of x is ', x);\n}\nwriteln('This message will not appear until all tasks are done ...');\n$ chpl cobegin.chpl -o cobegin\n$ sed -i -e 's|begin|cobegin|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nThis is the main task, my value of x is 0\nThis is task 2, my value of x is 0\nThis is task 1, my value of x is 5\nThis message will not appear until all tasks are done...\nAs you may have concluded from the Discussion exercise above, the variables declared inside a task are accessible only by the task, while those variables declared in the main task are accessible to all tasks.\nAnother, and one of the most useful ways to start concurrent/parallel tasks in Chapel, is the coforall loop. This is a combination of the for-loop and the cobeginstatements. The general syntax is:\ncoforall index in iterand\n{instructions}\nThis will start a new task (thread) for each iteration. Each task will then perform all the instructions inside the curly brackets. Each task will have a copy of the loop variable index with the corresponding value yielded by the iterand. This index allows us to customize the set of instructions for each particular task. Let’s write coforall.chpl:\nvar x = 10;\nconfig var numtasks = 2;\nwriteln('This is the main task: x = ', x);\ncoforall taskid in 1..numtasks {\n  var count = taskid**2;\n  writeln('this is task ', taskid, ': my value of count is ', count, ' and x is ', x);\n}\nwriteln('This message will not appear until all tasks are done ...');\n$ chpl coforall.chpl -o coforall\n$ sed -i -e 's|cobegin|coforall --numtasks=5|' shared.sh\n$ sbatch shared.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nThis is the main task: x = 10\nthis is task 1: my value of c is 1 and x is 10\nthis is task 2: my value of c is 4 and x is 10\nthis is task 4: my value of c is 16 and x is 10\nthis is task 3: my value of c is 9 and x is 10\nthis is task 5: my value of c is 25 and x is 10\nThis message will not appear until all tasks are done ...\nNotice the random order of the print statements. And notice how, once again, the variables declared outside the coforall can be read by all tasks, while the variables declared inside, are available only to the particular task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Task.1\n\n\n\n\n\nWould it be possible to print all the messages in the right order? Modify the code in the last example as required and save it as consecutive.chpl. Hint: you can use an array of strings declared in the main task, into which all the concurrent tasks could write their messages in the right order. Then, at the end, have the main task print all elements of the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Task.2\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following code gmax.chpl to find the maximum array element. Complete this code, and also time the coforall loop.\nuse Random, Time;\nconfig const nelem = 1e8: int;\nvar x: [1..nelem] int;\nfillRandom(x);                     // fill array with random numbers\nvar gmax = 0;\n\nconfig const numtasks = 2;       // let's pretend we have 2 cores\nconst n = nelem / numtasks;      // number of elements per task\nconst r = nelem - n*numtasks;    // these elements did not fit into the last task\nvar lmax: [1..numtasks] int;    // local maxima for each task\ncoforall taskid in 1..numtasks {\n  var start, finish: int;\n  start = ...\n  finish = ...\n  ... compute lmax for this task ...\n}\n\n// put largest lmax into gmax\nfor taskid in 1..numtasks do                        // a serial loop\n  if lmax[taskid] &gt; gmax then gmax = lmax[taskid];\n\nwritef('The maximum value in x is %14.12dr\\n', gmax);   // formatted output\nwriteln('It took ', watch.elapsed(), ' seconds');\nWrite a parallel code to find the maximum value in the array x. Be careful: the number of tasks should not be excessive. Best to use numtasks to organize parallel loops. For each task compute the start and finish indices of its array elements and cycle through them to find the local maximum. Then in the main task cycle through all local maxima to find the global maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the code of last Exercise using different number of tasks, and different sizes of the array x to see how the execution time changes. For example:\n$ ./gmax --nelem=100_000_000 --numtasks=1\nDiscuss your observations. Is there a limit on how fast the code could run?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionTry this…\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute your addition to the code to find gmax in the last exercise with:\ngmax = max reduce x;   // 'max' is one of the reduce operators (data parallelism example)\nTime the execution of the original code and this new one. How do they compare?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey idea\n\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to check whether there is a built-in function or method that can do what we want as efficiently (or better) than our house-made code. In this case, the reduce statement reduces the given array to a single number using the operation max, and it is parallelized. Here is the full list of reduce operations: +   *   &&   ||   &   |   ^   min   max.",

We started a serial for loop cycling through all locales, and on each locale we printed its name, i.e., the hostname of each node. This program ran in serial starting a task on each locale only after completing the same task on the previous locale. Note the order in which locales were listed.\nTo run this code in parallel, starting four simultaneous tasks, one per locale, we simply need to replace for with forall:\nforall loc in Locales do   // now this is a parallel loop\n  on loc do\n    writeln(\"this locale is named \", here.name[0..4]);\nThis starts four tasks in parallel, and the order in which the print statement is executed depends on the runtime conditions and can change from run to run:\nthis locale is named node1\nthis locale is named node3\nthis locale is named node2\nWe can print few other attributes of each locale. Here it is actually useful to revert to the serial loop for so that the print statements appear in order:\nuse MemDiagnostics;\nfor loc in Locales do\n  on loc {\n    writeln(\"locale #\", here.id, \"...\");\n    writeln(\"  ...is named: \", here.name);\n    writeln(\"  ...has \", here.numPUs(), \" processor cores\");\n    writeln(\"  ...has \", here.physicalMemory(unit=MemUnits.GB, retType=real), \" GB of memory\");\n    writeln(\"  ...has \", here.maxTaskPar, \" maximum parallelism to expect\");\n  }\n$ chpl test.chpl -o test\n$ sbatch distributed.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nlocale #0...\n  ...is named: node1.int.school.vastcloud.org\n  ...has 2 processor cores\n  ...has 29.124 GB of memory\n  ...has 2 maximum parallelism to expect\nlocale #1...\n  ...is named: node2.int.school.vastcloud.org\n  ...has 2 processor cores\n  ...has 29.124 GB of memory\n  ...has 2 maximum parallelism to expect\nlocale #2...\n  ...is named: node3.int.school.vastcloud.org\n  ...has 2 processor cores\n  ...has 29.124 GB of memory\n  ...has 2 maximum parallelism to expect\nNote that while Chapel correctly determines the number of cores available inside our job on each node (maximum parallelism) but lists the total physical memory on each node available to all running jobs which is not the same as the total memory per node allocated to our job.",

On top of this domain we define a 2D block-distributed array A of strings mapped to locales in exactly the same pattern as the underlying domain. Let us print out:\n\na.locale.id = the ID of the locale holding the element a of A\nhere.name = the name of the locale on which the code is running\nhere.maxTaskPar = the number of cores on the locale on which the code is running\n\nInstead of printing these values to the screen, we will store this output inside each element of A as a string: a = int + string + int is a shortcut for a = int:string + string + int:string\nuse BlockDist; // use standard block distribution module to partition the domain into blocks\nconfig const n = 8;\nconst mesh: domain(2) = {1..n, 1..n};\nconst distributedMesh: domain(2) dmapped new blockDist(boundingBox=mesh) = mesh;\nvar A: [distributedMesh] string; // block-distributed array mapped to locales\nforall a in A { // go in parallel through all n^2 elements in A\n  // assign each array element on the locale that stores that index/element\n  a = a.locale.id:string + '-' + here.name[0..4] + '-' + here.maxTaskPar:string + '  ';\n}\nwriteln(A);\nThe syntax boundingBox=mesh tells the compiler that the outer edge of our decomposition coincides exactly with the outer edge of our domain. Alternatively, the outer decomposition layer could include an additional perimeter of ghost points if we specify the following:\nconst mesh: domain(2) = {1..n, 1..n};\nconst largerMesh: domain(2) dmapped new blockDist(boundingBox=mesh) = {0..n+1,0..n+1};\n\nbut let us not worry about this for now.\nRunning our code on 3 locales, with 2 cores per locale, produces the following output:\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2\n1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2\n2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf we were to run it on 4 locales, with 2 cores per locale, we might see something like this:\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2\n2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2\n2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2\n2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   2-node4-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2   3-node3-2\n\n\nAs we see, the domain distributedMesh (along with the string array A on top of it) was decomposed into 3x1 blocks stored on the three nodes, respectively. Equally important, for each element a of the array, the line of code filling in that element ran on the same locale where that element was stored. In other words, this code ran via the parallel forall loop on 3 nodes, using up to 2 cores on each node (or whatever you specified) to fill in the corresponding array elements. Once the parallel loop is finished, the last command writeln(A) runs on locale 0 gathering remote elements from the other locales and printing them to standard output.\nNow we can print the range of indices for each sub-domain by adding the following to our code:\nfor loc in Locales do\n  on loc do\n    writeln(A.localSubdomain());\nOn 3 locales we should get:\n{1..3, 1..8}\n{4..6, 1..8}\n{7..8, 1..8}\nLet us count the number of threads by adding the following to our code:\nvar count = 0;\nforall a in A with (+ reduce count) { // go in parallel through all n^2 elements\n  count = 1;\n}\nwriteln(\"actual number of threads = \", count);\nIf our n=8 is sufficiently large, there are probably enough array elements per node (\\(8*8/3\\approx 21\\) in our case) to fully utilize the two available cores on each node, so our output might be:\n$ chpl test.chpl -o test\n$ sbatch distributed.sh\n$ cat solution.out\nactual number of threads = 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Data.2\n\n\n\n\n\nTry reducing the array size n to see if that changes the output (fewer threads per locale), e.g., setting n=3. Also try increasing the array size to n=20 and study the output. Does the output make sense?\n\n\n\nSo far we looked at the block distribution BlockDist. It will distribute a 2D domain among nodes either using 1D or 2D decomposition (in our example it was 2D decomposition 2x2), depending on the domain size and the number of nodes.\nLet us take a look at another standard module for domain partitioning onto locales, called CyclicDist. For each element of the array we will print out again\n\na.locale.id = the ID of the locale holding the element a of A\nhere.name = the name of the locale on which the code is running\nhere.maxTaskPar = the number of cores on the locale on which the code is running\n\nuse CyclicDist; // elements are sent to locales in a round-robin pattern\nconfig const n = 8;\nconst mesh: domain(2) = {1..n, 1..n};  // a 2D domain defined in shared memory on a single locale\nconst m2: domain(2) dmapped new cyclicDist(startIdx=mesh.low) = mesh; // mesh.low is the first index (1,1)\nvar A2: [m2] string;\nforall a in A2 {\n  a = a.locale.id:string + '-' + here.name[0..4]:string + '-' + here.maxTaskPar:string + '  ';\n}\nwriteln(A2);\n$ chpl -o test test.chpl\n$ sbatch distributed.sh\n$ cat solution.out\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2\n1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2\n1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2   2-node3-2\n0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2   0-node1-2\n1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2   1-node2-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWith 4 locales, we might see something like this:\n0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2__\n2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2__\n0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2__\n2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2__\n0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2__\n2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2__\n0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2   0-node1-2   1-node4-2__\n2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2   2-node2-2   3-node3-2__\n\n\nAs the name CyclicDist suggests, the domain was mapped to locales in a cyclic, round-robin pattern. We can also print the range of indices for each sub-domain by adding the following to our code:\nfor loc in Locales do\n  on loc do\n    writeln(A2.localSubdomain());\n{1..8 by 3, 1..8}\n{1..8 by 3 align 2, 1..8}\n{1..8 by 3 align 0, 1..8}\nIn addition to BlockDist and CyclicDist, Chapel has several other predefined distributions: BlockCycDist, ReplicatedDist, DimensionalDist2D, ReplicatedDim, BlockCycDim, and StencilDist – for details please see Chapel’s documentation on distributions. I would particularly advise to check out StencilDist which is an enhanced variant of the blockDist distribution: it reduces the amount of communication necessary for array accesses across locale boundaries on a grid.",

    "text": "A series of integers (1,2,3,4,5, for example), is called a range in Chapel. Ranges are generated with the .. operator, and are useful, among other things, to declare arrays of variables. For example, the following variable\nis a 2D array (matrix) with n rows and n columns of integer numbers, all initialized as 0. The two ranges 1..n not only define the size and shape of the array, they stand for the indices with which we could access particular elements of the array using the [X,X] notation. For example, stability[1,1] is the integer variable located at the first row and first column of the array stability, while stability[3,7] sits at the 3rd row and 7th column; stability[2,3..15] access columns 3 to 15 of the 2nd row, and stability[1..4,4] corresponds to the first 4 rows on the 4th column of stability.\nWe are now ready to start coding our computation … here is what we are going to do:",

    "text": "Structured iterations with for-loops\nWe want to iterate over all points in our image. When it comes to iterating over a given number of elements, the for-loop is what we want to use. The for-loop has the following general syntax:\nfor index in iterand do\n  instruction;\n  \nfor index in iterand {\n  instruction1;\n  instruction2;\n  ...\n  }\nThe iterand is a statement that expresses an iteration, e.g. it could be a range 1..15. index is a variable that exists only in the context of the for-loop, and that will be taking the different values yielded by the iterand. The code flows as follows: index takes the first value yielded by the iterand, and keeps it until all the instructions inside the curly brackets are executed one by one; then, index takes the second value yielded by the iterand, and keeps it until all the instructions are executed again. This pattern is repeated until index takes all the different values exressed by the iterand.\nIn our case we iterate both over all rows and all columns in the image to compute every pixel. This can be done with nested for loops like this:\nfor i in 1..n { // process row i\n  y = 2*(i-0.5)/n - 1;\n  for j in 1..n { // process column j, row i\n    point = 2*(j-0.5)/n - 1 + y*1i;   // rescale to -1:1 in the complex plane\n    stability[i,j] = pixel(point);\n  }\n}\nTo be able to compile the code, we also need a prototype pixel() function:\nproc pixel(z0) {\n  return z0; // to be replaced with an actual calculation\n}\nNow let’s compile and execute our code again:\n$ chpl juliaSetSerial.chpl\n$ sbatch serial.sh\n$ tail -f solution.out",

(EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: This overview session introduces all workshops in the Series and provides high-level answers to questions such as:\n\nWhat are the differences among Python plotting libraries – Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Vega-Altair, and Plotnine – and when should you choose one over another?\nWhy use ParaView for 3D scientific visualization, and what are its core capabilities?\nIn what ways can you use Python scripting in ParaView? (There is more than one!)\nWhat are the three primary approaches to creating animations in ParaView?\nWhat is in-situ visualization?\nAny domain-specific visualization tools covered in this Series?\nWhich scientific web visualization tools should you consider using in 2026?\n\nWe will also briefly cover tools not included in this Series, such as VisIt, Python mapping packages, Julia plotting libraries, and others, and explain why they were left out.\nPDF slides\n\n\n\n\nJan-20, 11am PT – Plotting in Python with Matplotlib (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Yohai Meiron (Univ. of Toronto)\nAbstract: Matplotlib is the foundational plotting library for Python, and is widely used in tandem with other scientific libraries (such as NumPy and Pandas) to visualize data across many different fields. It is a free and open source software library that offers fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot, making it a powerful tool for customizing figures to meet specific needs. In this workshop, we will use a Jupyter notebook to show you how to create common 2D plot types such as line, scatter, and heatmaps, and how to customize the labels, legend, and panel layout. We will briefly touch on using Matplotlib to produce animations and interactive visualizations. By the end of this one-hours session, you will have a basic understanding of the library’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPython notebook (external link)   Notebook in PDF format\n\n\n\n\nJan-27, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Seaborn (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Jarno van der Kolk (Univ. of Ottawa)\nAbstract: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics and is particularly well suited for displaying multi-dimensional data to get quick insight in a dataset.\nPrerequisites: Some knowledge of Python.\nPython notebook (external GitHub repo)   Notebook in PDF format\n\n\n\n\nJan-30, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Plotly (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: Plotly is an open-source visualization library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs in Python (and other languages), with support for a wide range of plot types. In this workshop, you will learn two ways to use Plotly: the high-level Plotly Express interface for rapid data exploration, and the more flexible Plotly Graph Objects interface for detailed customization. We will explore common plot types – line, scatter, bar, pie, and heatmap – as well as more advanced and 3D visualizations. You will learn how to display figures using different rendering backends, save them as image or HTML files, and view them inside Jupyter notebooks. Finally, we will take a look at Plotly Dash, a framework for building interactive data web applications with sliders, buttons, dropdown menus and other interactive elements.\nPrerequisites: Some knowledge of Python.\nOnline notes\n\n\n\n\nFeb-03, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Vega-Altair (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: How can you uncover the hidden trends in your thousands of data rows? This workshop teaches you how to create interactive charts from your tabular data. You’ll master histograms, time series plots, distributions, and multi-faceted graphs to transform your tables into impactful visualizations.\nOutline:\n\nCreating interactive charts with Altair\nBuilding a figure step-by-step using a grammar of graphics\nVisualizing time series and data distributions\nCreating multiple facets in a single figure\n\nSlides   GitHub repository\n\n\n\n\nFeb-06, 10am PT – Basic ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeakers: Alex Razoumov (SFU) and Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.) and Tyson Whitehead (Western Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView is an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed to run on a variety of hardware from individual laptops to large supercomputers. With ParaView, users can interactively visualize 2D and 3D datasets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles, animate these datasets over time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive visualization through a graphical user interface (GUI) and scripted visualization, including offscreen rendering, and is an easy and enjoyable tool to learn.\nIn this beginner’s workshop, we will explore ParaView’s interface, examine the types of data it can import, and learn how to use filters to build increasingly sophisticated visualization pipelines.\nPrerequisites: Please download and install ParaView v6.0 on your computer, and test that you can start ParaView before the workshop. We will provide all sample datasets.\nPDF slides   ZIP file with all ParaView slides and datasets\n\n\n\n\nFeb-10, 10am PT – The grammar of graphics in R and Python (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Tyson Whitehead (Western Univ.)\nAbstract: Most plotting packages offer a fixed set of built-in plot types to choose from. In contrast, the Grammar of Graphics defines a declarative framework for creating virtually unlimited visualizations by combining geometry, coordinate systems, facets, scales, guides, and themes. The most widely known implementation of this grammar is R’s ggplot2, with a lesser-known Python counterpart called Plotnine. This presentation introduces both libraries and demonstrates how the Grammar of Graphics can be used to build a wide range of plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides, scripts and data   PDF slides   Exploring Minard’s 1812 plot with ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nFeb-13, 10am PT – Introduction à ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView est un outil d’analyse et de visualisation de données à code source ouvert et multiplateforme, conçu pour fonctionner sur une variété de systèmes informatiques, des ordinateurs portatifs aux superordinateurs. Avec ParaView, on peut visualiser de manière interactive des ensembles de données 2D et 3D définis sur des particules ou des maillages structurés, adaptatifs ou non structurés. On peut ensuite animer ces données dans le temps et les manipuler à l’aide de divers filtres. ParaView prend en charge la visualisation interactive via une interface graphique, ainsi que la visualisation par script, y compris le rendu hors écran. C’est un outil facile et agréable à découvrir.\nDans cet atelier d’introduction, nous explorerons l’interface de ParaView, nous examinerons les types de données qu’il peut importer et nous apprendrons à utiliser des filtres pour construire des pipelines de visualisation de plus en plus sophistiqués.\nPrérequis: veuillez télécharger et installer le logiciel ParaView 6.0.1 sur votre ordinateur. Avant l’atelier, assurez-vous de pouvoir démarrer ParaView. Nous fournirons lors de la séance le matériel de formation.\nDiapositives (PDF)   Fichier ZIP contenant le matériel de formation\n\n\n\n\nFeb-24, 10am PT – ParaView scripting (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView’s Python library allows you to automate your visualization workflow by scripting your tasks and running them from the command line, either on your local machine or as a batch Slurm job on a remote HPC cluster, all without opening any windows. In this workshop, we will introduce ParaView’s Python tools, starting with using the Trace feature to convert GUI actions into scripts and then showing how to simplify and modify those scripts. You will learn how to run them using pvpython and pvbatch, and how to explore VTK data from the ParaView Python shell.\nPrerequisites: basic ParaView knowledge (importing and examining data, working with filters). To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nFeb-27, 10am PT – Scripter des visualisations via ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: La bibliothèque Python de ParaView vous permet d’automatiser votre processus de visualisation en programmant des séquences d’actions sous la forme de scripts et en les exécutant en ligne de commande, soit localement, soit via une tâche de calcul sur un superordinateur, le tout sans ouvrir aucune fenêtre de ParaView.\nCet atelier vous présentera les outils Python de ParaView, en commençant par l’utilisation de la fonction Trace pour convertir les actions de l’interface graphique en scripts, puis en vous montrant comment simplifier et modifier ces scripts. Vous apprendrez à les exécuter avec pvpython et pvbatch, et à explorer les données VTK depuis l’interpréteur Python de ParaView.\nPrérequis: connaissances de base de ParaView (importer et examiner des données, utiliser des filtres) et en programmation Python\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-03, 10am PT – ParaView animation (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView supports several approaches to animating data. In this session, we will focus on keyframe animation, where you can animate any property of any pipeline object, e.g. moving a slice through a volume by changing its origin, or animating a 2D contour through a 3D dataset by varying the contour value. We will also look at how to combine multiple timelines within a single animation. After that, we’ll work through several hands-on keyframe animation exercises and discuss how to create animations using Python scripting.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-06, 10am PT – Visualisations animées avec ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView permet d’animer de différentes façons la visualisation de données. Cet atelier sera consacré à l’animation par images clés, soit une méthode permettant d’animer selon n’importe quelle propriété d’un objet du pipeline. Nous verrons, entre autres, comment animer le plan de coupe d’un volume et aussi comment animer un contour 2D, selon sa valeur, dans un jeu de données 3D. Nous verrons également comment combiner plusieurs chronologies au sein d’une même animation. Enfin, nous réaliserons plusieurs exercices pratiques d’animation par images clés et aborderons la création d’animations à l’aide de scripts Python.\nPrérequis: connaissances de base de ParaView (importer et examiner des données, utiliser des filtres) et la compréhension de scripts Python utilisant le module ParaView.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-10, 10am PT – Remote and large-scale visualization in ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: In this more advanced session, you will learn how to perform remote and large-scale visualization on the Alliance’s HPC clusters, for cases where you do not want to – or simply cannot – download the dataset to your local computer.\nSmall-scale remote visualization can be accomplished using JupyterHub or Open OnDemand, running either standalone ParaView or a ParaView client within a remote desktop environment.\nFor larger-scale interactive visualization, we will run a parallel ParaView server for data processing and rendering on a cluster and connect to it from a ParaView client on your local computer. This setup enables interactive visualization of very large datasets (multi-GB and potentially TB-scale) without transferring data locally, and without being limited by your own system’s memory or CPU/GPU resources.\nWe will explore workflows involving both time and camera animation. We will then save the interactive visualization pipeline as a script and run it remotely as a batch job on the cluster, performing all rendering off-screen (without opening any windows) to generate animation files.\nFinally, we will discuss strategies for optimizing data for parallel I/O and the compute resources required to process very large datasets.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions. You will also need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer, to be able to log in to the remote cluster. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-13, 10am PT – Introductory VMD (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Dmitri Rozmanov (Univ. of Calgary)\nAbstract: Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is a dedicated tool for visualizing, analyzing, and animating molecular structures such as proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes, that is often used to post-process molecular dynamics simulations. In this hands-on workshop, attendees will learn to navigate the VMD interface, apply diverse molecular representations, and utilize VMD’s selection language to isolate key residues or ligands. The session will also cover loading molecular dynamics trajectories and generating high-quality renderings suitable for publication. By the end of this workshop, participants will have the fundamental skills to transform raw atomic data into meaningful visual insights.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-17, 10am PT – Programmable Filter / Source in ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView includes two highly flexible scripting tools – the Programmable Filter and Programmable Source – that allow you to design your own data-processing operations. With them, you can construct entirely new spatial discretizations, generate tailored 3D structures, or even import data stored in custom file formats. This hands-on session will demonstrate how these features open up new possibilities for scientific visualization workflows.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-20, 10am PT – Network visualization with Gephi (EN)\n\n\nSpeakers: Jarno van der Kolk (Univ. of Ottawa)\nAbstract: Gephi is an open-source platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs. It lets you visualize how different entities connect with each other. These could be social media networks, researchers publishing papers, internet traffic and so on. It also has robust statistical analysis built-in.\nPrerequisites: Have Gephi installed. Downloads are available at https://gephi.org.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-24, 10am PT – In-situ visualization with ParaView’s Catalyst2 (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: As numerical simulations continue to grow in size and complexity, the I/O bottleneck makes it impossible to save all generated data for later analysis. In-situ techniques address this challenge by running analysis and visualization in real time, while the data are still in memory on the HPC system running the simulation, eliminating the need to write everything to disk. Several in-situ visualization frameworks exist, including ParaView’s Catalyst, VisIt’s LibSim, Ascent, and SENSEI.\nIn this hands-on workshop, we will focus on Catalyst2, which allows you to analyze and visualize your simulation data using familiar ParaView pipelines. Catalyst2 provides an API for describing and passing data arrays – computational meshes and fields – from your simulation to the library, which then converts these arrays into the appropriate VTK data structures. This happens without requiring the user to understand the underlying VTK data model and without duplicating data in memory. This framework is designed to scale to very large datasets and to thousands of CPU cores via MPI.\nThe goal of this workshop is to instrument a simple C code with the Catalyst2 library and produce in-situ outputs, including data extracts and rendered images, using ParaView’s Python scripting.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions. Some knowledge of C would be helpful, but we’ll take things step by step. You will also need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer, to be able to log in to the remote cluster. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-27, 10am PT – Modern tools for web visualization (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: We will begin with a brief overview of the history of general-purpose multidimensional web visualization, including the development of vtk.js and ParaViewWeb. The main focus of this hands-on workshop, however, is to teach you how to use Trame, an open-source framework for building interactive web applications and dashboards for data visualization. Trame leverages Python and popular visualization tools such as VTK and ParaView, and it offers plugins for many other Python plotting libraries.\nIn this session, we will introduce Trame’s core concepts, demonstrate how to create simple interactive visualizations, and show how to put them online for easy sharing. This workshop is ideal for researchers and data scientists who want to turn their static visualizations into interactive, shareable experiences without needing extensive web development expertise.\nAdd to your calendar"

    "text": "November 26th, 2024, 10:00am–11:00am Pacific Time\nYou can find this page at   https://folio.vastcloud.org/annex\nAbstract: git-annex is a file synchronization tool designed to simplify the management of large (typically data-oriented) files under version control. Unlike Git, git-annex does not track file contents but rather facilitates the organization of data across multiple locations, both online and offline, enabling the creation of multiple copies for backup and redundancy, ensuring data safety and organization.     In the past, we have taught webinars on tools built upon git-annex, such as DataLad. In these tools the core functionality is typically provided by git-annex, so we believe it is crucial to understand how to effectively organize data using git-annex itself, without the distraction of additional features.     Personally, I have been utilizing git-annex for several years to manage my extensive collection of archived files across multiple drives stored on a shelf. git-annex provides built-in redundancy, ensuring that each individual repository or drive is aware of the location of all files on other drives, eliminating the need to power them on just to find a file. git-annex also offers online capabilities, allowing file synchronization across multiple filesystems and clusters to help you manage your research data."

    "section": "Git shortcomings for large files",
    "text": "Git shortcomings for large files\nGit was designed for version control of text files (codes, articles, any text-based documents). One major drawback of putting large data files under traditional version control is that it will double the size of your repository. You can use a hack to alleviate this problem, e.g. instead of putting the repository into the working directory, you can put it on a separate drive:\nmkdir large && cd large\ngit init --separate-git-dir=/Volume/drive/repoDir\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=someLargeFile bs=10240 count=$(( RANDOM + 1024 ))\ngit add someLargeFile\ngit commit -m \"...\"\nIn the working directory, this will create a text file .git containing the path to the actual repository. Now, when you commit large files to this repository, a copy will remain in the working directory (first drive), and another copy will go into the repository (second drive). Theoretically, you can even swap between different repositories (i.e. different drives) by swapping the content of .git, so you can have a copy of the same set of files on multiple drives.\nHowever, if you modify/delete a binary data file from the working directory, git will keep the older version in the repository. If this is a multi-GB data file and you no longer need it, you’ll be wasting space by keeping this file in the repository.\ngit-annex solves this problem by replacing data files with symbolic links. When you no longer need a file, you simply run a git-annex drop command to free some disk space. In addition, git-annex provides these features:\n\nIt can distribute files across multiple repositories, to have a different collection of files in each repository. You don’t use multiple bookcases to store the same set of books!\nIt can automate redundant storage, so that you can have multiple copies of files on different drives when you need backups.\nIt can work offline: you can synchronize data between drives without having to mount all of them at the same time. git-annex is fully distributed, i.e. each repository in the collection stores the full history, but it is often convenient to designate the main repository for syncing multiple secondary repositories on external drives. In addition, each repository knows about the location of all files in all other repositories, without having to mount the drives.\n\nIn short, git-annex helps me automate storage of a large number of files across a heterogeneous collection of standalone HDDs and SSDs sitting on a shelf and ensures that all my storage is redundant, i.e. I have at least two copies of all important files. If I ever run out of space, I can add another annex on a new drive, or even throw into the mix a remote server with extra storage.\nYou can read about the history of git-annex on Wikipedia.\nThere is a competing project Git Large File Storage (LFS), and a number of projects built on top of git-annex."

Sometimes Git development gets ahead of git-annex, and very occasionally things might behave weirdly if you have newer Git and older git-annex (but I never had any data lost). In such cases you might want to check if a new version of git-annex is available."

Follow the same two steps and update the repository:\nga unannex test80145      # unannex one file currently under git-annex control\nga dropunused --force 1   # drop the first unused file\ngit commit -m \"moved test80145 out of the annex\"\nNow if we do either git status or ga status, they will report that now we have a new, untracked file.\nIf you want to remove multiple files, e.g. file1, file2, file3, or an entire subdirectory subdir, you would do something like this:\nga unannex &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; &lt;file3&gt;\nga unannex &lt;subdir&gt;\nga unused                      # show all unlinked files\nga dropunused --force {1..5}   # adjust the number based on the previous command's output\n\n\nRemove file completely from the drive\nIf you don’t want to keep the data file, one possible solution is:\n\nreplace the link with the file content: ga unannex &lt;filename&gt;\ndrop the unused object file with a combination of ga unused and ga dropunused --force &lt;number&gt;\nupdate the repository: git commit -m \"moved &lt;filename&gt; out of the annex\"\ndelete the file rm &lt;filename&gt;\n\nAn alternative solution (we’ll see ga drop later when we work with remotes) could be:\nga drop --force &lt;filename&gt;   # drop a local copy (object)\nunlink  &lt;filename&gt;           # remove the link\nga sync                      # does git commit in the background\n\n\nGetting help\n\n`ga –help’ will list all available commands\nga &lt;command&gt; --help will give quick info about the command flags\nonline help pages for individual commands https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-command (replace command with the actual command)"

    "text": "Working with remotes\nThe real power of git-annex lies in its ability to distribute files across multiple annexes in a seamless manner. This is achieved through conventional Git remotes.\n\nRemote via a clone\nLet’s go to another drive and clone our existing repository there:\nga status   # make sure everything is committed\n\ncd ~/tmp/venus\ngit clone ~/tmp/earth/annex\ncd annex\n\nls          # there are symbolic links to non-existent destinations\ndu -s .     # currently no objects (data files)\ngit log     # see the history from earth\n\nga whereis    # all 15 files are on earth (1 copy of each)\n\npopulate 10\nga add .\ngit commit -m \"add 10 new files\"\n\nga whereis   # 15 files on earth, 10 files here\nIn a separate terminal, if we go to earth drive:\ncd ~/tmp/earth/annex\nga whereis   # shows only 15 local files\n\ngit remote add venus ~/tmp/venus/annex\nga sync\nga whereis   # 15 files here, 10 files on venus\nSo, what does ga sync do exactly? It performs these operations:\n\nrun local git commit with a generic message “git-annex in ”\nupdate the current repository with all changes made to its remotes, and\npush any changes in the current repository to its remotes, where you need to run ga sync to get them\n\nAn important innovation of ga sync is that it can work with remotes when they are offline:\n\nwhen pulling from an offline remote, it will check its “Inbox” branch (not actual name) to see if that remote has sync’ed to it earlier\nwhen pushing to an offline remote, it will push updates to its “Outbox” branch (not actual name)\n\nin earth ---\n  git-annex\n* main\n  synced/git-annex\n  synced/main\n\nin venus ---\n  git-annex\n* main\n  synced/main\nLet’s test communicating with offline annexes:\n--- venus annex ---\nga sync             # we made some changes to earth, need to update here\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=venus1 bs=1024 count=$(( RANDOM + 1024 ));\nga add venus1\ngit commit -m \"add venus1\"\nga sync\ncd ../..\nmv venus hidden     # hide it from earth\n\n--- earth annex ---\nga whereis venus1   # cannot find\nga sync             # update from the local branch\nga whereis venus1   # it is in venus\n\ncd ~/tmp\nmv hidden venus\n\n\nRemote from scratch\nLet’s move to another drive and create a new annex there from scratch with 10 new files:\ncd ~/tmp/mars/annex\ngit init\nga init \"mars\"\npopulate 10\nga add .\ngit commit -m \"add 10 new files\"\nga status   # all clean\nAt this point we still have an isolated annex. Let’s add our original repo as a remote for this repo:\ngit remote add earth ~/tmp/earth/annex\nga sync   # now fails, as you have two separate histories\nga sync --allow-unrelated-histories   # should work if no file conflicts\nIf there is a conflict, you may want to either (1) create a new repository via git clone like in the previous section, and then add new files by hand, or (2) try to rename the conflicting file.\nFinally, let’s do this:\n--- earth annex ---\nga sync\ngit remote               # mars is not its remote yet\nga whereis | grep mars   # but we can see the 10 files on mars!\nHere we see another example of offline communication: mars pushed into earth’s inbox earlier, and the last ga sync received those updates, even though we cannot connect to mars directly (no such remote). Let’s correct this by adding the remote:\n--- earth annex ---\ngit remote add mars ~/tmp/mars/annex\n\n\nCreate multiple copies\nThis is easily one of my favourite git-annex features!\n--- earth annex ---\npopulate 2\nexport coupleOfFiles=\"test03985 test69314\"\nga add $coupleOfFiles\ngit commit -m \"add 2 files\"\nga whereis $coupleOfFiles\nThese files have just one copy (here). In fact, in our annexes there are many files with a single copy:\nga whereis | grep -A 1 \"1 copy\"   # show all files with only one copy, in earth + mars + venus\nga whereis . | grep -A 1 \"1 copy\" | grep -B 2 \"\\[here\\]\"   # show local files with only one copy\nga sync\n\n--- mars annex ---\nga sync\nga whereis $coupleOfFiles   # 1 copy on earth\nga get --auto --numcopies=2 $coupleOfFiles\nga whereis $coupleOfFiles   # 2 copies\nga sync\nThe command ga get --auto --numcopies=2 can work with any list of files and/or directories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove files manually between remotes\nga whereis   # pick a file on venus\nga move &lt;filename&gt; --to here   # will likely fail (venus not linked)\ngit remote add venus ~/tmp/venus/annex\nga move &lt;filename&gt; --to here   # should work\nga find   # list all local files =&gt; pick a file\nga whereis test52930   # check its copies\nga move test52930 --to venus   # venus has to be online for this to work\n\n\nDrop a local copy\nga find   # list all local files =&gt; pick a file\nga drop test97806   # delete the object; keep the link: dangerous territory!\nUsually, git-annex will not let you delete a single copy, but you can --force it to permanently delete your data.\nIf you still want to keep a copy elsewhere, a safer approach would be:\nga drop --auto --numcopies=1 &lt;path&gt;   # drop all local copies if there is a remote copy\nga drop --auto --numcopies=2 &lt;path&gt;   # drop all local copies if there are 2 remote copies\n\n\nMove a file out of the annex and drop all annexed copies\n\nLets’ create a new file and put its content into two annexes:\n--- earth annex ---\npopulate 1\nexport testfile=test05873\nga add $testfile\nga copy $testfile --to mars\nga sync\nga whereis $testfile   # two copies: on earth and mars\n\n--- mars annex ---\nga sync\nga whereis $testfile   # two copies: on earth and mars\nobject=$(ls -l $testfile | awk '{print $11}')\nls -l $object          # actual file is stored here\nLet’s copy the file content back to replace the link:\nga unannex $testfile\nls              # the file replaced the link\nga unused       # shows no unlinked files\nls -l $object   # the file is still there, and it is unlinked\nWhat is going on here? It turns out that “ga unused” actually works across linked annexes, and it simply says that there is a link to this file somewhere in the other repository. To unannex this file’s copy everywhere, you need to tell ga unused to ignore that this file is checked out in other annexes:\nga unused --used-refspec=+master\nga dropunused --force 1\nga sync\nls -l $object   # the object is now gone locally\n\n--- earth annex ---\nls -l $testfile   # the file is still under annex here\nga sync\nls -l $testfile   # and now it is not\nga whereis $testfile               # this file is not under annex anywhere\nga unused --used-refspec=+master   # delete its copy here as well\nga dropunused --force 1\n\n--- mars annex ---\nls $testfile      # we have the unannexed copy (and only copy) in mars\n\n\nShow disk usage across all remotes\nga info &lt;path&gt;   # show local+global disk usage in a directory\n\n\nOrganize links into directories\nIn real life you put files into folders / directories. We can do the same with git-controlled links:\n--- mars annex ---\nmkdir data\ngit mv test{0,1,2}* data/\nga sync\n\n--- earth annex ---\nga sync\nls   # test0*,test1*,test2* should be in data/\nga get --auto --numcopies=2 data   # get files in /data with fewer than two copies\nga sync\n\n--- mars annex ---\nga get --auto --numcopies=2 data   # get files in /data with fewer than two copies\nga whereis data                    # all files will likely have two copies now\nga sync"

The division of integers in Chapel returns an integer, then, as rows and cols are integers, we must have 80 as real so that the result is not truncated.\n$ chpl baseSolver.chpl -o baseSolver\n$ sbatch serial.sh\n$ tail -f solution.out\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 20: 2.0859\nTemperature at iteration 40: 1.42663\n...\nTemperature at iteration 460: 0.826941\nTemperature at iteration 480: 0.824959\nTemperature at iteration 500: 0.823152\n\n\n\nThe idea is simple: after each iteration of the while loop, we must compare all elements of Tnew and T, find the greatest difference, and update delta with that value. The following nested for loops should do the job:\n// update delta, the greatest difference between Tnew and T\ndelta = 0;\nfor i in 1..rows do {\n  for j in 1..cols do {\n    tmp = abs(Tnew[i,j] - T[i,j]);\n    if tmp &gt; delta then delta = tmp;\n  }\n}\nClearly there is no need to keep the difference at every single position in the array, we just need to update delta if we find a greater one.\n$ chpl baseSolver.chpl -o baseSolver\n$ sbatch serial.sh\n$ tail -f solution.out\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 20: 2.0859\nTemperature at iteration 40: 1.42663\n...\nTemperature at iteration 460: 0.826941\nTemperature at iteration 480: 0.824959\nTemperature at iteration 500: 0.823152\n\n\n\nFor example, lets use a 650 x 650 grid and observe the evolution of the temperature at the position (200,300) for 10000 iterations or until the difference of temperature between iterations is less than 0.002; also, let’s print the temperature every 1000 iterations.\n$ chpl --fast baseSolver.chpl -o baseSolver\n$ ./baseSolver --rows=650 --cols=650 --iout=200 --jout=300 --niter=10000 --tolerance=0.002 --nout=1000\nTemperature at iteration 0: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 1000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 2000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 3000: 25.0\nTemperature at iteration 4000: 24.9998\nTemperature at iteration 5000: 24.9984\nTemperature at iteration 6000: 24.9935\nTemperature at iteration 7000: 24.9819\nFinal temperature at the desired position after 7750 iterations is: 24.9671\nThe greatest difference in temperatures between the last two iterations was: 0.00199985\n\n\n\nWithout --fast the calculation will become slower by ~95X."

You can examine the selected default renderer with:\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.renderers   # show default and available renderers\nYou can overwrite the default by setting it manually inside your session or inside your code, e.g.\npio.renderers.default = 'browser'          # open each plot in a new browser tab\npio.renderers.default = 'notebook'         # plot inside a Jupyter notebook\npio.renderers.default = 'plotly_mimetype'  # default for Jupyter, fails with remote JH\nIf you want to have this setting persistent across interactive sessions (and not set it manually or in the code), you can create a file ~/.plotly_startup.py with the following:\ntry:\n    import plotly.io as pio\n    pio.renderers.default = \"browser\"\nexcept ImportError:\n    pass\nand set export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.plotly_startup.py in your ~/.bashrc file. Note that $PYTHONSTARTUP can be used to customize only your interactive Python sessions (in the terminal or Jupyter), i.e. it does not execute when you run a script. When running a script, you could insert\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.renderers.default = \"browser\"\ndirectly into the script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking in a Jupyter notebook\nLet me demonstrate this using a renderer with a simple plot. Inside a Jupyter notebook, set the renderer and then create a basic line plot:\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.renderers.default = 'notebook'\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom numpy import linspace, sin\nx = linspace(0.01,1,100)\ny = sin(1/x)\nline = go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='lines+markers', name='sin(1/x)')\n   # this is a trace = fundamental building block of a plot;\n   # think of it as a single set of data and the instructions on how to draw it\n# Option 1\ngo.Figure([line])   # pass data = a list of trace instances\n                    # plot should automatically dispay inside the notebook\n# Option 2\nfig = go.Figure([line])   # no plot displayed at this point\nfig.show()                # plot should dispay inside the notebook\nIf you want to save your figure, you can mouse over the plot and select “Download plot as a PNG”. Alternatively, you can do this from the code:\nfig.write_html(\"lines.html\")            # interactive HTML file\nfig.write_image(\"lines.png\", scale=2)   # static, supports svg, png, jpg/jpeg, webp, pdf\n                                        # requires 'kaleido' library and Chromium engine library\n                                        # will take a while in Jupyter\nThe last command is meant for the Python shell, not for Jupyter. If run in Jupyter, it’ll use an external library kaleido which in turn will the Chromium engine system library, and the whole process will take minutes – something to keep in mind.\n\n\nWorking in a Python shell\nNow, let me switch briefly to running Plotly on my computer:\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.renderers.default   # 'browser'\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom numpy import linspace, sin\nx = linspace(0.01,1,100)\ny = sin(1/x)\nline = go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='lines+markers', name='sin(1/x)')\nfig = go.Figure([line])   # no plot displayed at this point\nfig.show()                # plot should dispay inside a new browser tab\n\nfig.write_html(\"lines.html\")            # interactive HTML file\nfig.write_image(\"lines.png\", scale=2)   # static, supports svg, png, jpg/jpeg, webp, pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey point\n\n\n\nIn general, use fig.show() to enforce displaying the plot (shell or Jupyter). Depending on your setup, this command might not be necessary inside a Jupyter notebook if you create a figure with go.Figure(...) without saving it to a variable – then your plot should be displayed automatically.\n\n\n\n\nRunning a local script\nLet me save the following as a local file test.py:\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.renderers.default = \"browser\"\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nfrom numpy import linspace, sin\nx = linspace(0.01,1,100)\ny = sin(1/x)\nline = go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='lines+markers', name='sin(1/x)')\nfig = go.Figure([line])   # no plot displayed at this point\nfig.show()\nand then run it:\npython test.py\nThis should open a new local browser tab with the plot.\n\n\nRunning a remote script\nOn a remote system, there is no browser in which we could open a new tab. To run this script from the command line on the training cluster, we need to change the last line fig.show() to fig.write_image(\"lines.png\") to write directly into a file.\nYou can find more details at https://plotly.com/python/renderers.",

Besides the obvious question of how to encode your data structures in a file, you might also want to consider portability (the ability to write/read data across different operating systems and different programming languages and libraries), the inclusion of metadata (data description), I/O bandwidth and file sizes, compression, and the ability to read/write data in parallel for large datasets. In this introductory in-person workshop, we will cover all these aspects starting from the very basic file formats and ending with scalable scientific dataset formats.

There are some differences too, e.g.\n\nNetCDF has an ecosystem of conventions, e.g. a CF (climate-forecast) convention\nNetCDF is understood natively by ParaView, HDF5 not so easily\nHDF5 was developed specifically for storing hierarchical/nested data\n\nHere we only show NetCDF.\npip install netCDF4\nimport numpy as np\nimport netCDF4 as nc\nf = nc.Dataset(\"array.nc\", 'w', format='NETCDF4')\nf.createDimension('x', 100)\nf.createDimension('y', 100)\nf.createDimension('z', 100)\nrho = f.createVariable('density', 'f4', ('x', 'y', 'z'))   # f4 stands for 4-byte float\nrho[:,:,:] = np.random.random(size=(100,100,100))\nf.close()   # 4,008,192 bytes\nNow let’s read it:\nimport netCDF4 as nc\nds = nc.Dataset(\"array.nc\")\nprint(ds)  # can see the dimensions, variables, precision\nprint(ds[\"density\"].shape)\nprint(ds[\"density\"][:])   # it is a numpy array\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise Compression 1\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn on compression when saving the variable.

Compare the file size to the size of embedded data – do they agree? Give a reason behind that.\n\n\n\nIf you want the functionality of pandas (easy 2D table manipulation) in a multidimensional array, then you can use xarray Python library. Xarray library is built on top of numpy and pandas. There are two main data structures in xarray:\n\nxarray.DataArray is a fancy, labelled version of numpy.ndarray\nxarray.Dataset is a collection of multiple xarray.DataArray’s that share dimensions\n\npip install xarray\nimport xarray as xa\nimport numpy as np\ndata = xa.DataArray(\n    np.random.random(size=(8,6)),\n    dims=(\"y\",\"x\"),  # dimension names (row,col); we want `y` to represent rows and `x` columns\n    coords={\"x\": [10,11,12,13,14,15], \"y\": [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]}  # coordinate labels/values\n)\ndata\nWe can access various attributes of this array:\ndata.values                 # the 2D numpy array\ndata.values[0,0] = 0.53     # can modify in-place\ndata.dims                   # ('y', 'x')\ndata.coords               # all coordinates, cannot modify!\ndata.coords['x'][1]       # a number\ndata.x[1]                 # the same\nArray subsetting:\n\nisel() selects by index, could be replaced by [index1] or [index1,…]\nsel() selects by value\ninterp() interpolates by value\n\ndata.isel()      # same as `data`\ndata.isel(y=1)   # second row\ndata.isel(y=0, x=[-2,-1])    # first row, last two columns\nVectorized operations:\ndata + 100      # element-wise like numpy arrays\n(data - data.mean()) / data.std()    # normalize the data\ndata - data[0,:]      # use numpy broadcasting =&gt; subtract first row from all rows\nLet’s initialize two 2D arrays with the identical dimensions:\ncoords = {\"x\": np.linspace(0,1,5), \"y\": np.linspace(0,1,5)}\ntemp = xa.DataArray(      # first 2D array\n    20 + np.random.randn(5,5),\n    dims=(\"y\",\"x\"),\n    coords=coords\n)\npres = xa.DataArray(       # second 2D array\n    100 + 10*np.random.randn(5,5),\n    dims=(\"y\",\"x\"),\n    coords=coords\n)\nFrom these we can form a dataset:\nds = xa.Dataset({\"temperature\": temp, \"pressure\": pres,\n                 \"bar\": (\"x\", 200+np.arange(5)), \"pi\": np.pi})\nds\nSubsetting works the usual way:\nds.sel(x=0)     # each 2D array becomes 1D array, the 1D array becomes a number, plus a number\nds.temperature.sel(x=0)     # 'temperature' is now a 1D array\nds.temperature.sel(x=0.25, y=0.5)     # one element of `temperature`\nWe can save this dataset to a file:\nds.to_netcdf(\"double.nc\")\nReading it is very easy:\nnew = xa.open_dataset(\"double.nc\")\nWe can even try opening this 2D dataset in ParaView - select (x,y) and deselect Spherical.\nSo far we’ve been working with datasets in Cartesian coordinates. How about spherical geometry – how do we initialize and store a dataset in spherical coordinates (longitude - latitude - elevation)? Very easy: define these coordinates and your data arrays on top, put everything into an xarray dataset, and then specify the following units:\nds.lat.attrs[\"units\"] = \"degrees_north\"   # this line is important to adhere to CF convention\nds.lon.attrs[\"units\"] = \"degrees_east\"    # this line is important to adhere to CF convention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise NetCDF CF convention\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \\(100\\times 300\\) (nlat\\(\\times\\)nlon) spherical dataset with two variables adhering to the NetCDF CF convention."

    "text": "VTK = versatile format for spatially defined data\nVTK is a computer graphics and visualization library that’s been around since early 1990s. Originally it was C++ only, but now there are interfaces from other languages as well, including Python.\n\n\nlegacy VTK: ASCII or binary data, ASCII metadata, could write manually or through APIs\nXML VTK: usually binary data, compression, parallel I/O, write via API\n\nIn simple cases using the original VTK library is probably an overkill, as doing even simple things could involve quite a few function calls. VTK is a very powerful library, but there is also a very steep learning curve. Consider the number of functions inside VTK’s Python interface:\npip install vtk pyevtk\nimport vtk\n[i for i in dir(vtk)]                    # returns 3593 functions\n[i for i in dir(vtk) if \"Writer\" in i]   # returns 104 functions\nWe will see an example of using the original VTK library below. But first let us consider a simple example of writing data on a Cartesian mesh (ImageData in VTK speak). For this we can use a more lightweight library called PyEVTK which is dedicated library for exporting data stored in numpy arrays to VTK files.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pyevtk.hl import imageToVTK\nnx, ny, nz = 30, 30, 30\nncells = nx * ny * nz\nnpoints = (nx+1) * (ny+1) * (nz+1)\npressure = np.random.rand(ncells).reshape((nx, ny, nz))      # double precision\ntemp = np.random.rand(npoints).reshape((nx+1, ny+1, nz+1))   # double precision\nimageToVTK(\"image\", cellData = {\"pressure\": pressure}, pointData = {\"temp\": temp})\nTry loading this file into ParaView.\n\nNow let’s try writing a StructuredGrid dataset to a file:\nfrom pyevtk.hl import gridToVTK\nimport numpy as np\n\nnx, ny, nz = 30, 30, 30\nxside, yside, zside = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0\n\nncells = nx * ny * nz\nnpoints = (nx+1) * (ny+1) * (nz+1)\n\nX = np.linspace(0, xside, nx+1, dtype='float64')   # three coordinate axes\nY = np.linspace(0, yside, ny+1, dtype='float64')\nZ = np.linspace(0, zside, nz+1, dtype='float64')\n\nx, y, z = np.meshgrid(X,Y,Z)   # 3D coordinate arrays\n\n# perturb the grid to make it more interesting\nx += (0.5 - np.random.random(npoints).reshape(nx+1,ny+1,nz+1)) * 0.5 * xside/nx\ny += (0.5 - np.random.random(npoints).reshape(nx+1,ny+1,nz+1)) * 0.5 * yside/ny\nz += (0.5 - np.random.random(npoints).reshape(nx+1,ny+1,nz+1)) * 0.5 * zside/nz\n\npressure = np.random.rand(ncells).reshape((nx, ny, nz))\ntemp = np.random.rand(npoints).reshape((nx+1, ny+1, nz+1))\ngridToVTK(\"structured\", x, y, z, cellData = {\"pressure\" : pressure}, pointData = {\"temp\" : temp})\nFinally, here is the promised example with the original VTK library:\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom writeNodesEdges import writeObjects\n\nH = nx.complete_bipartite_graph(15,5) # two sets of nodes\nprint(nx.number_of_nodes(H), 'nodes and', nx.number_of_edges(H), 'edges')\n\npos = nx.spring_layout(H,dim=3,k=1)   # dictionary of positions keyed by node\nxyz = [list(pos[i]) for i in pos]     # convert to a nested list of positions\n\ndegree = [d for i,d in H.degree()]\nprint('degree =', degree)\nwriteObjects(xyz, edges=H.edges(), scalar=degree, name='degree', fileout='network')\nThis wrote to a PolygonalData file. Try loading this file into ParaView and displaying the network with nodes and edges.\nIf you want to write to an UnstructuredGrid file, replace the last line with:\nwriteObjects(xyz, edges=H.edges(), scalar=degree, name='degree', fileout='network', method = 'vtkUnstructuredGrid')"

    "text": "Distributed parallelization (multi-node)\nFor distributed-memory parallelism, ParallelStencil.jl can interoperate with 3rd-party frameworks to parallelize array computations on many processes. While it might be possible to run ParallelStencil.jl alongside DistributedArrays.jl or SharedArrays.jl, these packages use specialized data structures that are not directly portable to ParallelStencil.jl’s parallel frameworks. A better approach is combining ParallelStencil.jl with ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl, which provides implicit distributed arrays built out of regular local arrays on each MPI rank.\n\nIntro to ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl\nLet’s study the code globalGridDemo.jl:\n\nusing formatted @printf instead of println as it separates output from different ranks into different lines; println tends to mix them somewhere in the output buffers somewhat randomly\nby default, init_global_grid will initialize MPI and finalize_global_grid will finalize MPI; here doing this by hand, as we might want to run test() many times, and MPI can be initialized only once\nour computational domain is a unit square\nthere is no global array per se, in the sense provided by such packages as DistributedArrays.jl and SharedArrays.jl – instead, local arrays cover the domain with some overlap at the inner boundaries, and together they emulate a global grid; you can only explicitly read/write array elements on the processor rank where these elements are hosted in the respective local array\nnx_g(), ny_g(), nz_g provide the global grid size (cumulative over all local arrays minus the borders)\nbased on the current processor rank:\n\n[x_g(i, dx, A) for i in 1:nx] gives the global x-coordinates of all elements in the local array A\n[y_g(j, dy, A) for j in 1:ny] gives the global y-coordinates of all elements in the local array A\n[z_g(k, dz, A) for k in 1:nz] gives the global z-coordinates of all elements in the local array A\n\non each rank we compute only the internal array elements [2:end-1] in each dimension\nthe inner boundary zones are updated via MPI, by calling update_halo!\nthe outer boundary zones are not updated in this example at all; in a real problem they will be used for outer boundary conditions\n\n\n\n\nusing ImplicitGlobalGrid\nusing MPI\nusing Printf\n\nMPI.Init()   # finalize by hand, as we want to run test() many times,\n             # and MPI can be initialized only once\n\nfunction test()\n    nx, ny, nz= 5, 5, 1;

There are some issues compiling Chapel with LLVM and GPU support on InfiniBand clusters, so I bypassed them by creating a container that can be used on any of our clusters, whether built on InfiniBand, or Ethernet, or OmniPath interconnect.\n\nthe container almalinux.sif can be used only on one node (no multi-node parallelism), but it does support multiple GPUs\ninstalled Chapel into an overlay image chapel.img (we’ll study overlays below)\n\nHere is how I would use it on Fir:\ncd ~/scratch\nsalloc --time=0:30:0 --nodes=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --gpus-per-node=v100l:1 \\\n       --account=cc-debug --reservation=asasfu_756\nnvidia-smi   # verify that we can see the GPU on the node\ngit clone ~/chapelBare $SLURM_TMPDIR/\n\nmodule load apptainer\nexport SRC=/project/6003910/razoumov/apptainerImages/chapelGPU20240826\napptainer shell --nv -B $SLURM_TMPDIR --overlay $SRC/chapel.img:ro $SRC/almalinux.sif\n\nnvidia-smi   # verify that we can see the GPU inside the container\nsource /extra/c4/chapel-2.1.0/util/setchplenv.bash\nexport CHPL_GPU=nvidia\nexport CHPL_CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.4\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-12.4/bin\ncd $SLURM_TMPDIR/gpu\nchpl --fast probeGPU.chpl -L/usr/local/cuda-12.4/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/stubs\n./probeGPU\nLet me know if you are interested in playing with it on a machine with an NVIDIA GPU, and I can share both container files with you.",

    "section": "Running MPI programs from within a container",
    "text": "Running MPI programs from within a container\nMPI (message passing interface) is the industry standard for distributed-memory parallel programming. There are several implementations: OpenMPI, MPICH, and few others.\nMPI libraries on HPC systems usually depend on various lower-level runtime libraries – interconnect, RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), PMI (process management interface) and others – that vary from one HPC cluster to another, so they are hard to containerize. Thus no generic --mpi flag could be implemented for containers that would work across the network on different HPC clusters.\nThe official Apptainer documentation provides a good overview of running MPI codes inside containers. There are 3 possible modes of running MPI programs with Apptainer:\n\n1. Rely on MPI inside the container\n\nIn the MPI-inside-the-container mode you would start a single Apptainer process on the host:\napptainer exec -B ... --pwd ... container.sif mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS ./mpicode\nThe cgroup limitations from the Slurm job are passed into the container which sets the number of available CPU cores inside the container. In this setup the command mpirun uses all available (to this job) CPU cores.\n\n limited to a single node …\n\n no need to adapt container’s MPI to the host; just install SSH into the container\n\n can build a generic container that will work across multiple HPC clusters (each with a different setup)\n\n\n\n2. Hybrid mode\nHybrid mode uses host’s MPI to spawn MPI processes, and MPI inside the container to compile the code and provide runtime MPI libraries. In this mode you would start a separate Apptainer process for each MPI rank:\n\nmpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS apptainer exec -B ... --pwd ... container.sif ./mpicode\n\n can span multiple nodes\n\n container’s MPI should be configured to support the same process management mechanism and version (e.g. PMI2 / PMIx) as the host – not that difficult with a little bit of technical knowledge (reach to us for help)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Bind mode\nBind mode bind-mount host’s MPI libraries and drivers into the container and use exclusively them, i.e. there is no MPI inside the container. The MPI code will need to be compiled (when building the container) with a version of MPI similar to that of the host – typically that MPI will reside on the build node used to build the container, but will not be installed inside the container.\nI have zero experience with this mode, so I won’t talk about it here in detail.\n\n\n\n\nExample: hybrid-mode MPI\nFor this course I have already built an MPI container that can talk to MPI on the training cluster. For those interested, you can find the detailed instructions here, but in nutshell I created a definition file that:\n\nbootstraps from docker://ubuntu:22.04\ninstalls the necessary fabric and PMI packages, Slurm client, few others requirements\n\nand then used it to build mpi.sif which I copied over to the training cluster into /project/def-sponsor00/shared.\n\n\n\n\n\ncd ~/tmp\nmodule load openmpi apptainer\nunzip -j /project/def-sponsor00/shared/introHPC.zip codes/distributedPi.c\n\n# need to set a couple of things\nmkdir -p ~/.openmpi\necho \"btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none\" &gt;&gt; ~/.openmpi/mca-params.conf   # shared-memory comm setting\nexport PMIX_MCA_psec=native   # allow mpirun inside the container to use host's PMI\n\nexport CONTAINER=/project/def-sponsor00/shared/mpi.sif\napptainer exec $CONTAINER mpicc -O2 distributedPi.c -o distributedPi\n\nsalloc --ntasks=4 --time=0:5:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\n\n# try running on the the host\nmpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS ./distributedPi   # error: compiled for Ubuntu, cannot run on Rocky Linux\n\n# try running inside the contaner\nmpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS apptainer exec $CONTAINER ./distributedPi\nsrun apptainer exec $CONTAINER ./distributedPi   # same as previous line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: WRF container with self-contained MPICH\nThese instructions describe building a WRF Apptainer image following this build script. This container is large (8.1GB compressed SIF file, 47GB uncompressed sandbox) and includes everything but the kitchen sink, including multiple perl and Python 3 libraries and 3rd-party packages. It was created for a support ticket, but what’s important for us is that it also installs MPICH entirely inside the container, not relying on host’s OpenMPI. This means that we’ll be limited to MPI runs on one node.\nTo run an MPI code inside this container, it is important to pass -e to Apptainer to avoid loading MPI from the host:\ncd ~/scratch\nmodule load apptainer/1.2.4\nsalloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=4 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --account=def-razoumov-ac\nexport APPTAINERENV_NTASKS=$SLURM_NTASKS\napptainer shell -e --pwd $PWD wrf.sif\n\nexport PATH=/data/WRF/Libs/MPICH/bin:$PATH\n\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; distributedPi.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n  double total, h, sum, x;\n  long long int i, n = 1e10;\n  int rank, numprocs;\n  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);\n  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);\n  MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numprocs);\n  h = 1./n;\n  sum = 0.;\n  if (rank == 0)\n    printf(\"Calculating PI with %d processes\\n\", numprocs);\n  printf(\"process %d started\\n\", rank);\n  for (i = rank+1; i &lt;= n; i += numprocs) {\n    x = h * ( i - 0.5 );    //calculate at center of interval\n    sum += 4.0 / ( 1.0 + pow(x,2));\n  }\n  sum *= h;\n  MPI_Reduce(&sum,&total,1,MPI_DOUBLE,MPI_SUM,0,MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n  if (rank == 0)\n    printf(\"%.17g\\n\", total);\n  MPI_Finalize();\n  return 0;\n}\nEOF\n\nmpicc distributedPi.c -o mpi\nmpirun -np $NTASKS ./mpi",

    "section": "Overlays",
    "text": "Overlays\nIn the container world, an overlay image is a file formatted as a filesystem. To the host filesystem it is a single file. When you mount it into a container, the container will see a filesystem with many files.\nAn overlay mounted into an immutable SIF image lets you store files without rebuilding the image. For example, you can store your computation results, or compile/install software into an overlay.\nAn overlay can be:\n\na standalone writable ext3 filesystem image (most useful),\na sandbox directory,\na writable ext3 image embedded into the SIF file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you write millions of files, do not store them on a cluster filesystem – instead, use an Apptainer overlay file for that. Everything inside the overlay will appear as a single file to the cluster filesystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe direct apptainer overlay command requires Singularity 3.8 / Apptainer 1.0 or later and a relatively recent set of filesystem tools, e.g. it won’t work in a CentOS7 VM. It should work on a VM or a cluster running Rocky Linux 8.5 or later.\n\n\n\ncd ~/tmp\napptainer pull ubuntu.sif docker://ubuntu:latest\nmodule load apptainer\nsalloc --time=0:30:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\napptainer overlay create --size 512 small.img   # create a 0.5GB overlay image file\napptainer shell --overlay small.img ubuntu.sif\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the container any newly-created top-level directory will go into the overlay filesystem:\nApptainer&gt; df -kh             # the overlay should be mounted inside the container\nApptainer&gt; mkdir -p /data     # by default this will go into the overlay image\nApptainer&gt; cd /data\nApptainer&gt; df -kh .           # using overlay; check for available space\nApptainer&gt; for num in $(seq -w 00 19); do\n             echo $num\n             # generate a binary file (1-33)MB in size\n             dd if=/dev/urandom of=test\"$num\" bs=1024 count=$(( RANDOM + 1024 ))\n           done\nApptainer&gt; df -kh .     # should take ~300-400 MB\nIf you exit the container and then mount the overlay again, your files will be there:\napptainer shell --overlay small.img ubuntu.sif\n\nApptainer&gt; ls /data     # here is your data\nYou can also create a new overlay image with a directory inside with something like:\napptainer overlay create --create-dir /data --size 512 overlay.img   # create an overlay with a directory\nIf you want to mount the overlay in the read-only mode:\napptainer shell --overlay small.img:ro ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt;  touch /data/test.txt    # error: read-only file system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInto the same container at the same time, you can mount many read-only overlays, but only one writable overlay.\n\n\nTo see the help page on overlays (these two commands are equivalent):\napptainer help overlay create\napptainer overlay create --help\n\nSparse overlay images\nSparse images use disk more efficiently when blocks allocated to them are mostly empty. As you add more data to a sparse image, it can grow (but not shrink!) in size. Let’s create a sparse overlay image:\napptainer overlay create --size 512 --sparse sparse.img\nls -l sparse.img                   # its apparent size is 512MB\ndu -h --apparent-size sparse.img   # same\ndu -h sparse.img                   # its actual size is much smaller (316K)\nLet’s mount it and fill with some data, e.g. a few files:\napptainer shell --overlay sparse.img ubuntu.sif\n\nApptainer&gt; mkdir -p /data && cd /data\nApptainer&gt; for num in $(seq -w 0 4); do\n             echo $num\n             # generate a binary file (1-33)MB in size\n             dd if=/dev/urandom of=test\"$num\" bs=1024 count=$(( RANDOM + 1024 ))\n           done\nApptainer&gt; df -kh .     # should take ~75-100 MB, pay attention to \"Used\"\n\ndu -h sparse.img        # shows actual usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBe careful with sparse images: not all tools (e.g. backup/restore, scp, sftp, gunzip) recognize sparsefiles ⇒ this can potentially lead to data loss and other bad things …\n\n\n\n\nExample: installing Conda into an overlay\nInstalling native Anaconda on HPC clusters is a bad idea for a number of reasons. Instead of Conda, we recommend using virtualenv together with our pre-compiled Python wheels to install Python packages into your own virtual environments.\nOne of the reasons we do not recommend Conda is that it creates a large number of files in your directories. You can alleviate this problem by hiding Conda files inside an overlay image:\n\ntakes a couple of minutes, results in 32k+ files that are hidden from the host\nno need for root, as you don’t modify the container image\nstill might not be the most efficient use of resources (non-optimized binaries)\n\nHere is one way you could install Conda into an overlay image:\ncd ~/tmp\napptainer pull ubuntu.sif docker://ubuntu:latest\napptainer overlay create --size 1200 conda.img   # create a 1200M overlay image\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh\n\napptainer shell --overlay conda.img -B /home ubuntu.sif\n\nApptainer&gt; mkdir /conda && cd /conda\nApptainer&gt; df -kh .\nApptainer&gt; bash /home/${USER}/tmp/miniconda.sh\n  agree to the license\n  use /conda/miniconda3 for the installation path\n  no to initialize Miniconda3\nApptainer&gt; find /conda/miniconda3/ -type f | wc -l   # 32,621 files\nApptainer&gt; df -kh .   # uses ~840M once finished, but more was used during installation\nThese 32k+ files appear as a single file to the Lustre metadata server (which is great!).\napptainer shell ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; ls /conda                            # no such file or directory\n\napptainer shell --overlay conda.img ubuntu.sif\nApptainer&gt; source /conda/miniconda3/bin/activate\n(base) Apptainer&gt; type python   # /conda/miniconda3/bin/python\n(base) Apptainer&gt; python        # works\nIf you want to install large Python packages, you probably want to resize the image:\ne2fsck -f conda.img         # check your overlay's filesystem first (required step)\nresize2fs -p conda.img 2G   # resize your overlay\nls -l conda.img             # should be 2GB\nNext mount the resized overlay into the container, and make sure to pass the -C flag to force writing config files locally (and not to the host):\napptainer shell -C --overlay conda.img ubuntu.sif   # /home/$USER won't be available\n\nApptainer&gt; cd /conda/miniconda3\nApptainer&gt; source bin/activate\n(base) Apptainer&gt; conda install numpy\n(base) Apptainer&gt; df -kh .   # so far used 1.8G out of 2.0G\n(base) Apptainer&gt; python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\n&gt;&gt;&gt; np.pi",

After having built it, you can move the container to a regular filesystem.\n\n\nThe importance of temp space when running large workflows\nBy default, for its internal use Apptainer allocates some temporary space in /tmp which is often in RAM and is very limited. When it becomes full, Apptainer will stop working, so you might want to give it another, larger temporary space via the -W flag. In practice, this would mean doing something like:\n\non your own computer or on a production cluster’s login node:\n\nmkdir /localscratch/tmp\napptainer shell/exec/run ... -W /localscratch/tmp &lt;image.sif&gt;\n\ninside a Slurm job:\n\nmkdir $SLURM_TMPDIR/tmp\napptainer shell/exec/run ... -W $SLURM_TMPDIR/tmp &lt;image.sif&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRegard /tmp inside the container as temporary space.

To create a container image, you need a machine that:\n\nruns Linux,\nhas Apptainer installed,\nhas Internet access, and\nideally where you have root (or sudo) permissions, otherwise all permissions inside the container will be messed up, and you won’t have root or sudo access  ➜  you won’t be able to install or upgrade packages (this requires root).\n\nIt is possible to install packages and modify system (root-owned) files inside the container without being root, either:\n\nby using --fakeroot to modify system files inside the container as if you were root (covered in this section; this option might be prone to errors, depending on the complexity of your container), or\nby using a --remote build option (covered in this section).\n\nIf installing packages is not important to you, i.e. you are planning to use the container as is for production purposes, you can probably create an image on an HPC cluster. If you run into problems, please ask for help at support@tech.alliancecan.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn Apptainer the user always remains the same inside and outside of the container. In other words, if you enter a container without root privileges, you won’t be able to obtain root privileges within the container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have access to your own Linux computer, it is best to build your images there (root access and performance from a local drive). Alternatively, you can use a VM where you have root access. In the Alliance, we provide free cloud projects to researchers for spinning up VMs.\n\n\n\n\nBuild consideration #2: host’s filesystem limitations\nAnother limitation to keep in mind is the type and bandwitdth of the host’s filesystem in which you are building the container. Parallel filesystems such as Lustre and GPFS (used on our clusters for /home, /scratch, /project) have some limitations that might lead to errors when creating a container – for technical details of some of the issues see this page.\nIn addition, building containers involves a large number of small file operations slowing down parallel filesystems which were not optimized for this type of I/O. For this reason, when building containers on our clusters, we highly recommend doing this inside a Slurm job in $SLURM_TMPDIR (SSD on a compute node).\n\n\n\nDemo: building a development container in a sandbox as root\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou need to be root in this section. For this reason, in this section I will run a demo on a machine with root access, and you can simply watch.\n\n\n\nPull an existing Docker image from Docker Hub.\nCreate a modifiable sandbox directory into which you can install packages.\nAdd packages and perhaps your application and data.\nConvert the sandbox into a regular SIF image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default, Apptainer containers are read-only, i.e. while you can write into bind-mounted directories, normally you cannot modify files inside the container.\n\n\nTo build a writable container into which you can install packages, you need root access. The --sandbox flag below builds a sandbox to which changes can be made, and the --writable flag launches a read-write container. In this example ubuntu.dir is a directory on the host filesystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will log in as user centos (with sudo privileges) to the training cluster and run apptainer with the full path (as apptainer from CVMFS will not be accessible to sudo):\n\nssh centos@apptainer\nmkdir -p tmp && cd tmp\nalias apptainer=/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2023/x86-64-v3/Core/apptainer/1.3.5/bin/apptainer\nalias sudo='sudo '   # so that the command after sudo is checked for alias\napptainer build --sandbox ubuntu.dir docker://ubuntu   # sudo not yet required\ndu -sh ubuntu.dir                              # 82M, before installing packages\nsudo apptainer shell --writable ubuntu.dir     # start the sandbox in writable mode;\n                                               # sudo needed to install packages as root\nApptainer&gt; apt-get update            # update the package index files\nApptainer&gt; wget                      # not available\nApptainer&gt; whoami                    # I am root, so can install software system-wide\nApptainer&gt; apt-get -y install wget   # will fail here if Apptainer run without root\n\nsudo du -sh ubuntu.dir               # 139M; sudo necessary to scan root directories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAbove you might see a warning when running ... apptainer shell --writable ...\nWARNING: Skipping mount /etc/localtime [binds]: /etc/localtime doesn't exist in container\noccurs when you try to mount a file/directory into the container without that destination already inside the container. You can simply ignore this message. We will learn bind-mounting in the next section.\n\n\nTo convert the sandbox to a regular non-writable SIF container image, I will use:\nsudo apptainer build ubuntu.sif ubuntu.dir\nsudo rm -rf ubuntu.dir\nls -lh ubuntu.sif            # 68M (compressed)\napptainer shell ubuntu.sif   # can now start it as non-root\n\nApptainer&gt; wget\nApptainer&gt; ...\n\nscp ubuntu.sif user01@apptainer.vastcloud.org:/project/def-sponsor00/shared\nAs a regular user on the training cluster, I should be able to use this image now:\nchmod -R og+rX /project/def-sponsor00/shared   # give read access to all users\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer shell /project/def-sponsor00/shared/ubuntu.sif\n\n\nFakeroot in a sandbox: no need for root!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou need an Apptainer 1.1 or later in this section, as well as fakeroot-sysv utility on the host preceding fakeroot in the path. Our CVMFS modules have been patched to include this utility inside the module’s private bindir, and on standalone Linux systems fakeroot-sysv is typically installed when you install the Apptainer package. This is to say that the approach outlined in this section most likely works both on our production clusters and on most standalone Linux systems with Apptainer 1.1 (or higher). However, it is always preferable to modify system files in the containers as root, and with --fakeroot you might still run into problems with more complex Apptainer images, so always monitor your output for errors.\n\n\nWe will follow the same recipe:\n\nPull an existing Docker image from Docker Hub.\nCreate a modifiable sandbox directory into which you can install packages.\nAdd packages and perhaps your application and data.\nConvert the sandbox into a regular SIF image.\n\nHowever, this time we will start the sandbox shell with the --fakeroot flag that will let us write system files inside the container as a regular (non-root) user. As a reminder, we need the sandbox to be able to modify files inside the container, i.e. we cannot do this inside an immutable SIF image.\nmkdir -p tmp && cd tmp\nmodule load apptainer\nsalloc --time=2:0:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\napptainer build --sandbox ubuntu.dir docker://ubuntu   # create the sandbox in ubuntu.dir/\ndu -sh ubuntu.dir                                      # 82M, before installing packages\napptainer shell --fakeroot --writable ubuntu.dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise: cannot find /project\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point you might see the following output:\nINFO:    User not listed in /etc/subuid, trying root-mapped namespace\nINFO:    Using fakeroot command combined with root-mapped namespace\nWARNING: Skipping mount /etc/localtime [binds]: /etc/localtime doesn't exist in container\nWARNING: By using --writable, Apptainer can't create /project destination automatically without overlay or underlay\nFATAL:   container creation failed: mount hook function failure: mount /project-&gt;/project error: while mounting /project: destination /project doesn't exist in container\nHow would you solve this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, inside the container, we can install the software we need, e.g.\nApptainer&gt; apt-get update\nApptainer&gt; apt-get -y install wget\n\ndu -sh ubuntu.dir   # 140M\nTo convert the sandbox to a regular non-writable SIF container image, use\napptainer build ubuntu.sif ubuntu.dir\nrm -rf ubuntu.dir\napptainer shell ubuntu.sif\n\nApptainer&gt; wget\nApptainer&gt; ...\n\n\nBuilding a container from a definition file: root or not\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on your Apptainer installation, you may or may not need to be root in this section. Try to follow along, if you want, or alternatively simply watch this demo.\n\n\nInside your working directory, create a new file python.def:\ncd ~/tmp\nnano python.def\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:24.04\n\n%post\n    apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y python3\n\n%runscript\n    python3 -c 'print(\"Hello World! Hello from our custom Apptainer image!\")'\nWe will bootstrap our image from a minimal Ubuntu 24.04 Linux Docker image as then run it as a regular user:\nunset APPTAINER_BIND\napptainer build python.sif python.def   # in Apptainer 1.0 important to run this as root; it can\n                                    # run without sudo but will use /etc/subuid mappings;\n                                    # running this as regular user will result in errors;\n                                    # in properly configured Apptainer 1.1 and higher can run\n                                    # this as regular user\nls -l python.sif           # 80M\napptainer run python.sif   # Hello World! Hello from our custom Apptainer image!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore advanced definition files may have these sections:\n%setup - commands in this section are first executed on the host system outside of the container\n%files - copy files into the container with greater safety\n%environment - define environment variables that will be set at runtime\n%startscript - executed when the `instance start` command is issued\n%test - runs at the very end of the build process to validate the container using a method of your choice\n%labels - add metadata to `/.apptainer.d/labels.json` within your container\n%help - this text can then be displayed with `apptainer run-help ...` in the host\nas described in the user guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey point\n\n\n\nApptainer definition files are used to define the build process and configuration for an image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDiscussion\n\n\n\nAt this point, how do we install additional packages into this new container? There are several (three?) options.\n\n\n\n\nRemote builder: no need for root!\nIf you have access to a platform with Apptainer installed but you don’t have root access to create containers, you may be able to use the Remote Builder functionality to offload the process of building an image to remote cloud resources. One popular cloud service for this is the Remote Builder from SyLabs, the developers of Apptainer. If you want to use their service, you will need to register for a cloud token via the link on the their page. Here is one possible workflow:\n\nLog in at https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder (can sign in with an existing GitHub account).\nGenerate an access token at https://cloud.sylabs.io/auth/tokens and copy it into your clipboard.\nOn the training cluster create a new local file test.def:\n\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:24.04\n\n%post\n    apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y python3\n\n%runscript\n    python3 -c 'print(\"Hello World! Hello from our custom Apptainer image!\")'\n\nBuild the image remotely and then run it locally:\n\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer remote login    # enter the token\napptainer remote status   # check that you are able to connect to the services\napptainer build --remote test.sif test.def\nls -l test.sif   # 62M\napptainer run test.sif   # Hello World! Hello from our custom Apptainer image!\nYou can find more information on remote endpoints in the official documentation.",

    "text": "Practical Apptainer workflows\nParaView and VisIt are two scientific applications that are quite difficult to compile from source. We have both installed on the production clusters – but let’s imagine that we don’t, and you need to install your own. The two scenarios below show how you can do that.\n\nWith ParaView, we download an off-the-shelf Docker image with a pre-compiled ParaView server.\nWith VisIt, we start with a bare-bones Ubuntu image and then download a pre-compiled VisIt for Ubuntu, unpack it into the sandbox, and install other required libraries.\n\n\nRun client-server ParaView from a container\nParaView is a very popular open-source scalable 3D scientific visualization tool. To visualize large datasets on an HPC cluster, you can run ParaView in a client-server mode, with your local ParaView GUI acting as a client, and a remote ParaView server on the cluster. Let’s try to run ParaView server from inside an Apptainer image.\n\n\n\nLet’s search Docker Hub for “paraview” or “topologytoolkit”. Pick a family of images and a tag (version) and copy the command for it, e.g. the command could be docker pull topologytoolkit/ttk-dev:5.11.0. Note that the URL syntax in the apptainer pull ... command is different, so you will need to edit it accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSome things to watch out for\n\n\n\n\nImage size – building a 5 GB image might take hours to build.\nImage age – avoid using outdated images, e.g. a 5-year-old ParaView build.\nWhether or not it supports GPU.\nRead the description: we are are looking for pvserver and not much else.\n\n\n\nHere are few ParaView images I tried:\n\nthe official docker://kitware/paraview:ci-fedora42-20250915 took 1h20m to create a 4.6G SIF image, but there does not seem to be any paraview or pvserver in it\nsomeone else’s recent docker://finback9/paraview-base:0.1 has ParaView 6.0 and took 60m to create a 818M SIF image, but it is parallel and requires a compatible MPI installation to run\nTTK’s docker://topologytoolkit/ttk-dev:5.11.0 took 25m to create a 779M SIF image, but its latest is 5.11 – let’s go with this one\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following commands require online access and will work only on Fir (and the training cluster!) where compute nodes can access Internet.\ncd ~/tmp\nmodule load apptainer\nsalloc --time=2:0:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\napptainer pull topologytoolkit.sif docker://topologytoolkit/ttk-dev:5.11.0   # took 25m to create a 779M SIF image, latest is 5.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn other production clusters – Nibi, Rorqual, Trillium, Narval – compute nodes do not have Internet access, so you will have to use a two-step approach there:\ncd ~/scratch\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/contrib/download-frozen-image-v2.sh\nsh download-frozen-image-v2.sh build ttk:latest   # download an image\n                                                  # from Docker Hub into build/\ncd build && tar cvf ../ttk.tar * && cd ..\nmodule load apptainer\nsalloc --cpus-per-task=1 --time=0:30:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --account=...\napptainer build topologytoolkit.sif docker-archive://ttk.tar   # build the Apptainer image;\n                                                               # wait for `Build complete`\n/bin/rm -rf build topologytoolkit.tar\n\n\nLet’s use this image! While still inside the job (on a compute node), copy the dataset sineEnvelope.nc from /project/def-sponsor00/shared/paraview.zip into a ~/data folder and then start the ParaView server:\nunzip /project/def-sponsor00/shared/paraview.zip -d ~ data/sineEnvelope.nc   # extract sample data into ~/data\napptainer exec -B /home paraviewBase.sif pvserver\nIf successful, it should say something like:\n“Accepting connection(s): node1.int.apptainer.vastcloud.org:11111”\n– write down the node name and the port number as you will need them in the next step.\nOn your laptop, set up SSH port forwarding to this compute node and port:\nssh username@apptainer.vastcloud.org -L 11111:node1:11111\nNext, start ParaView 5.11.x on your computer and connect to localhost:11111, and then load the dataset and visualize it.\n\n\nExercise: switch to another Linux distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise: switch to another Linux distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try creating an image with another Linux distribution:\napptainer pull debian.sif docker://debian:latest\nTry running nano text editor inside one of these containers. If it is not installed, install it yourself: create a writable sandbox directory, enter it with --fakeroot --writable, install nano (google the commands), convert it back to SIF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: latest Python image\nWe did something similar with a Python container earlier, so you can refer to the notes in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise: latest Python image\n\n\n\n\n\nPull the latest Python image from Docker Hub into an Apptainer image. It should take few minutes to build it.\n1. How large is the resulting image?\n1. Run container’s Python with the apptainer exec command. Which version of Python did it install?\n1. Do some math, e.g. print \\(\\pi\\).\n1. When you exit Python, you will be back to your host system’s shell.\n1. Now try running Python via the apptainer shell command.\n1. Which operating system does this container run?\nmodule load apptainer\nsalloc --cpus-per-task=1 --time=2:00:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\napptainer pull python.sif docker://???\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: CPU-based PyTorch image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise: CPU-based PyTorch image\n\n\n\n\n\nPull a recent CPU-based PyTorch image from Docker Hub into an Apptainer image.\nmodule load apptainer\nsalloc --cpus-per-task=1 --time=2:00:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\napptainer pull pytorch.sif docker://???\n\nWhich operating system does this container run?\nTry running some basic PyTorch commands inside this image:\n\nimport torch\nA = torch.tensor([[2., 3., -1.], [1., -2., 8.], [6., 1., -3.]])\nprint(A)\nb = torch.tensor([5., 21., -1.])\nprint(b)\nx = torch.linalg.solve(A, b)\nprint(x)\ntorch.allclose(A @ x, b)   # verify the result\nFor more info on working with PyTorch tensors watch our webinar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn our clusters we have PyTorch installed natively, both for CPUs and GPUs, so no need to rely on a container for this.\n\n\n\n\nRun a VisIt visualization script\nVisIt is an open-source scalable visualization package that is notoriously difficult to compile. Fortunately, it is available as a precompiled package for Ubuntu, so you can run it inside an Ubuntu container.\nIn this demo we will use VisIt to visualize a 3D dataset.\nWe have two options:\n\nunpack VisIt inside the container   ⇒   larger container image, fewer files on the host\nunpack VisIt into a /scratch directory outside the container   ⇒   smaller container image, more files on the host\n\nLet’s go with option (1) which will make the container self-sufficient. Here are our steps:\n\nBuild an Ubuntu sandbox and enter it with --fakeroot --writable flags:\n\napptainer build --sandbox ubuntu.dir docker://ubuntu\nmkdir ubuntu.dir/{project,scratch}\napptainer shell --fakeroot --writable ubuntu.dir\n\nVisIt’s CLI isn’t purely headless – it starts VisIt’s viewer, which needs X11 and other libraries. Let’s install these into the sandbox:\n\nApptainer&gt; apt-get -y update\nApptainer&gt; apt-get install -y libfontconfig libx11-6 libxkbcommon0 libxcursor1 libxext6 liblapack3\nApptainer&gt; apt-get install -y wget\n\nDownload and unpack the latest VisIt package for Ubuntu into the sandbox:\n\n\n\n\nmkdir /visit   # create a top-level directory inside the sandbox\ncd /visit\nwget https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/releases/download/v3.4.2/visit3_4_2.linux-x86_64-ubuntu24.tar.gz\ntar xvfz visit3_4_2.linux-x86_64-ubuntu24.tar.gz\n/bin/rm visit3_4_2.linux-x86_64-ubuntu24.tar.gz\n\nConvert the sandbox into a SIF image:\n\napptainer build visit.sif ubuntu.dir    # creates a 590M SIF image\n/bin/rm -rf ubuntu.dir\n\nCopy the dataset sineEnvelope.nc from /project/def-sponsor00/shared/paraview.zip into a ~/data folder:\n\nunzip /project/def-sponsor00/shared/paraview.zip -d ~ data/sineEnvelope.nc\n\nStart VisIt’s Python shell inside the container:\n\napptainer exec visit.sif /visit/visit3_4_2.linux-x86_64/bin/visit -cli -nowin\n\nPaste the following visualization script:\n\nOpenDatabase(\"~/data/sineEnvelope.nc\")\nAddPlot(\"Pseudocolor\", \"density\")\n\nv = GetView3D()                 # get current view attributes\nfrom math import *\nphi = 0.3     # 0 &lt;= phi &lt;= 2*pi\ntheta = 0.3   # -pi/2 &lt;= theta &lt;= pi/2\nv.viewNormal = (cos(theta)*cos(phi),cos(theta)*sin(phi),sin(theta))\nSetView3D(v)\n\na = GetAnnotationAttributes()   # get current  annotation attributes\na.axes3D.xAxis.title.font.scale = 0.2  # smaller = smaller text\na.axes3D.xAxis.label.font.scale = 0.2\na.axes3D.yAxis.title.font.scale = 0.2\na.axes3D.yAxis.label.font.scale = 0.2\na.axes3D.zAxis.title.font.scale = 0.2\na.axes3D.zAxis.label.font.scale = 0.2\nSetAnnotationAttributes(a)\n\nDrawPlots()\n\ns = SaveWindowAttributes()\ns.fileName = 'test'\ns.outputToCurrentDirectory = 1\nSetSaveWindowAttributes(s)\nSaveWindow()\n\ncheck the resulting image test*.png",

    "text": "As you just saw, Python’s lists are ordered sets of objects that you access via their position/index. Dictionaries are unordered sets in which the objects are accessed via their keys. In other words, dictionaries are unordered key-value pairs.\nConsider two lists:\nThere is nothing connecting these two lists, as far as figuring a person’s favourite colour goes. You could do something like this using indices:\nbut this is a little too convoluted … A dictionary can help you connect the two datasets directly:\nYou can also cycle using .keys(), .values() and .items() methods:\nThere are other ways to organize the same information using dictionaries. For example, you can create a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per person:\nThe benefit of this approach is that you can have many more attributes per person than just name and colour, and this is a very common way to organize structured and/or hierarchical data in Python. The downside is that – to search for by name – you have to do it explicitly:\nor in a single line:\nFinally, if you want performance, you might want to consider the following approach:\nHere we: 1. apply the lambda (anonymous) function  lambda x: x%2 == 0  to each item in range(1,11); it returns True or False, 2. create an iterator yielding only those items in range(1,11) for which the lambda function produced True, and 3. cycle through this iterator.\nUsing this approach, we can create an iterator of all people matching a name:\nHere we: 1. apply the lambda function lambda person: person[\"name\"] == \"Jeff\" to each item in the list data; it returns True or False, 2. create an iterator yielding only those items in data for which the lambda function produced True, and 3. create a list from this iterator, in this case containing only one element.\nGoing back to the basics, you can see where dictionary got its name:\nLet’s modify values:\nDeleting dictionary items:\nValues can also be numerical:\nAnd so can be the keys:",

This short lecture-style course will be followed by a separate, full-day interactive Python workshop in which we will thoroughly study all these topics through hands-on exercises. This follow-up workshop will occur in the weeks after the 2024 HSS Winter Series.\nThe goal of today’s workshop is to demo some Python functionality, to give you a taste of the language’s capabilities. We are not learning Python today, and we will not be doing any hands-on exercises, so please relax and watch the presentation. The three followup sessions on February 26-28 will teach you Python with many hands-on exercises (6 hours in total)."

    "text": "Why Python?\nPython is a free, open-source programming language first developed in the late 1980s and 90s that became really popular for scientific computing in the past 15 years. With Python in a few minutes you can: - analyze thousands of texts, - process tables with billions of records, - manipulate thousands of images, - restructure and process data any way you want.\n\nPython vs. Excel\n\nUnlike Excel, Python can read any type of data, both structured and unstructured.\nPython is free and open-source, so no artificial limitations on where/how you run it.\nPython works on all platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, etc.\nData manipulation is much easier in Python. There are hundreds of data processing, machine learning, and visualization libraries.\nPython can handle much larger amounts of data: limited not by Python, but by your available computing resources. In addition, Python can run at scale (in parallel) on larger systems.\nPython is more reproducible (rerun / modify the script).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython vs. other programming languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython pros\nPython cons\n\n\n\n\nelegant scripting language\nslow (interpreted, dynamically typed)\n\n\neasy to write and read code\nuses indentation for code blocks\n\n\npowerful, compact constructs for many tasks\n\n\n\nvery popular across all fields\n\n\n\nhuge number of external libraries"

    "section": "High-level data collections",
    "text": "High-level data collections\nPython has a number of built-in composite data structures: tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries. Here we take a look at lists and dictionaries.\n\nLists\nA list stores many values in a single structure:\nevents = [267, 1332, 1772, 1994, 493, 1373, 1044, 156, 1515, 1788]  # array of years\nprint('events:', events)\nprint('length:', len(events))\nprint('first item of events is', events[0])   # indexing starts witgh 0\nevents[2] = 1773   # individual elements are mutable\nprint('events is now:', events)\nevents.append(1239)\nevents.append(606)\nprint('events is now:', events)\nevents.pop(4)      # remove element #4\nprint('events is now:', events)\nevents.remove(...)   # remove by value (first occurrence)\nLists can be inhomogeneous:\na = []\na.append(1)\na.append('Vancouver')\na.append(3.5)\nand can even be nested (contain other lists):\na.append(['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars'])\na\na[-1]\nYou can search inside a list:\n'Venus' in a[-1]       # returns True\n'Pluto' in a[-1]       # returns False\n\na[-1].index('Venus')   # returns 1 (position index)\nplanets = a[-1]\nplanets.sort()         #  you sort lists alphabetically\nThe initial list I showed you was generated via a list comprehension:\n[random.randint(0,2024) for i in range(10)]\n[x**2 for x in range(1,31)]\n[x**2 for x in range(1,11) if x%2==1]   # list only odd number squares\ncolours = ['red', 'green', 'white', 'black', 'pink', 'yellow']\n[c for c in colours if len(c) &lt;= 4]\nLet’s compute a difference between two lists, i.e. find unique elements in each:\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10]\nb = [1, 2, 5, 10]\nfor i in a:\n    if i not in b:\n        print(i, \"is not in b\")\n\nfor i in b:\n    if i not in a:\n        print(i, \"is not in a\")\nIn Python very often you can have multiple solutions to the same problem. E.g., let’s write a script to get the frequency of all elements in a given list:\nSolution 1:\na = [77, 9, 23, 67, 73, 21, 23, 9]\na.count(77)        # prints 1\na.count(9)         # prints 2\nfor i in a:\n    a.count(i)    # counts the frequency of 'i' in list 'a' ... redundant output\nSolution 2:\na = [77, 9, 23, 67, 73, 21, 23, 9]\nfor i in set(a):\n    print(i, \"is seen\", a.count(i))   # no redundant output\nSolution 3:\na = [77, 9, 23, 67, 73, 21, 23, 9]\nimport collections\nprint(collections.Counter(a))\n\n\nDictionaries\nAs you just saw, Python’s lists are ordered sets of objects that you access via their position/index. Dictionaries are unordered sets in which the objects are accessed via their keys. In other words, dictionaries are unordered key-value pairs.\nConsider two lists:\nnames = ['Mary', 'John', 'Eric', 'Jeff', 'Anne']               # people\ncolours = ['orange', 'green', 'blue', 'burgundy', 'turquoise'] # and their respective favourite colours\nThere is nothing connecting these two lists, as far as figuring a person’s favourite colour goes. You could do something like this using indices:\ncolours[names.index('Eric')]\nbut this is a little too convoluted … A dictionary can help you connect the two datasets directly:\nfav = {}  # start with an empty dictionary\nfor name, colour in zip(names, colours):   # go through both lists simultaneously\n    fav[name] = colour\n\nfav   # {'Mary': 'orange', 'John': 'green', 'Eric': 'blue', 'Jeff': 'burgundy', 'Anne': 'turquoise'}\n\nfav['John']      # returns 'green'\nfav['Mary']      # returns 'orange'\nfor key in fav:\n    print(key, fav[key])   # will print the names (keys) and the colours (values)\nThere are other ways to organize the same information using dictionaries. For example, you can create a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per person:\nnames = ['Mary', 'John', 'Eric', 'Jeff', 'Anne']                 # people names\ncolours = ['orange', 'green', 'blue', 'burgundy', 'turquoise']   # and their respective favourite colours\nages = [25, 23, 27, 32, 26]                                       # let's include a third attribute\n\ndata = []\nfor name, colour, age in zip(names, colours, ages):   # go through both lists simultaneously\n    data.append({'name': name, 'colour': colour, 'age': age})\n\nperson = data[0]\nprint(person)\nprint(person[\"name\"], person[\"colour\"])\nThe benefit of this approach is that you can have many more attributes per person, that just name and colour, and this is very common way to organize structured and/or hierarchical data in Python. The downside is that – to search for by name – you have to do it explicitly:\nfor person in data:\n    if person[\"name\"]==\"Jeff\": print(person[\"colour\"], person[\"age\"])\nor in a single line:\n[(person[\"colour\"], person[\"age\"]) for person in data if person[\"name\"]==\"Jeff\"]\nFinally, if you want performance, this will be the fastest way:\nlist(filter(lambda person: person[\"name\"] == \"Jeff\", data))\n\n\n\nHere we: 1. apply the anonymous “lambda” function lambda person: person[\"name\"] == \"Jeff\" to each item in the collection data; it returns True or False, 2. create an iterator yielding only those items in data that produced True, and 3. create a list from this iterator, in this case containing only one element.\nYou can see where dictionary got its name:\nconcepts = {}\nconcepts['list'] = 'an ordered collection of values'\nconcepts['dictionary'] = 'a collection of key-value pairs'\nconcepts\nLet’s modify values:\nconcepts['list'] = concepts['list'] + ' - very simple'\nconcepts['dictionary'] = concepts['dictionary'] + ' - used widely in Python'\nconcepts\nValues can also be numerical:\ngrades = {}\ngrades['Mary'] = 5\ngrades['John'] = 4.5\ngrades\nAnd so can be the keys:\ngrades[1] = 2\ngrades"

    "text": "Numpy\nPython lists are very general and flexible, which is great for high-level programming, but it comes at a cost. The Python interpreter can’t make any assumptions about what will come next in a list, so it treats everything as a generic object with its own type and size. As lists get longer, eventually performance takes a hit.\nPython does not have any mechanism for a uniform/homogeneous list, where – to jump to element #1000 – you just take the memory address of the very first element and then increment it by (element size in bytes) x 999. Numpy library fills this gap by adding the concept of homogenous collections to python – numpy.ndarrays – which are multidimensional, homogeneous arrays of fixed-size items (most commonly numbers, but could be strings too). This brings huge performance benefits!\nTo speed up calculations with numpy, typically you perform operations on entire arrays, and this by extension applies the same operation to each array element. Since numpy was written in C, it is much faster for processing multiple data elements than manually looping over these elements in Python.\nLearning numpy is outside the scope of this introductory workshop, but there are many packages built on top of numpy that could be used in HSS."

For example, I might see some useful text inside the &lt;div&gt; container tag:\n&lt;div class=\"list-title mathjax\"&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"descriptor\"&gt;Title:&lt;/span&gt; This is the first article's title\n&lt;/div&gt;\nLet’s search for all &lt;div&gt; tags with an attribute class starting with “list-title”:\ndivs = mainpage.findAll(\"div\", attrs={'class':'list-title'})\nlen(divs)   # number of article titles on this page\nLet’s inspect the first title:\ndiv[0]\ndiv[0].text           # get the actual text inside this container\ndiv[0].text.strip()   # remove leading and trailing whitespaces and end-of-line characters\ndiv[0].text.strip().replace('Title: ', '')\nWe can wrap this in a loop through all titles:\nfor div in divs:\n    print(div.text.strip().replace('Title: ', ''))\nLet’s store our data in a dataframe with three columns:\ntitles = []\ndivs = mainpage.findAll(\"div\", attrs={'class':'list-title'})\nfor div in divs:\n    titles.append(div.text.strip().replace('Title: ', ''))\n\nauthors = []\ndivs = mainpage.findAll(\"div\", attrs={'class':'list-authors'})\nfor div in divs:\n    authors.append(div.text.strip().replace('Authors:', '').replace('\\n', ''))\n\nsubjects = []\ndivs = mainpage.findAll(\"div\", attrs={'class':'list-subjects'})\nfor div in divs:\n    subjects.append(div.text.strip().replace('Subjects: ', ''))\n\nd = {'titles': titles, 'authors': authors, 'subjects': subjects}\npapers = pd.DataFrame(d)\npapers\nFinally, let’s filter articles based on a topic:\nmask = [\"Machine Learning\" in subject for subject in papers.subjects]\npapers[mask]\n\nMore advanced: extracting all links from a standalone HTML file\n\nimport requests                 # to download the html data from a site\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup   # to parse these html data\nimport pandas as pd             # to store our data in a dataframe\n\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom urllib3.response import HTTPResponse\nclass FileAdapter(HTTPAdapter):\n    def send(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        resp = HTTPResponse(body=open(request.url[7:], 'rb'), status=200, preload_content=False)\n        return self.build_response(request, resp)\n\nsession = requests.Session()\nsession.mount('file://', FileAdapter())\nr = session.get('file:///path/to/file.html')\nmainpage = BeautifulSoup(r.text, \"html.parser\")\nlinks = mainpage.findAll(\"a\", href=True)\nfor link in links:\n    print(link['href'])"

(EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: This overview session introduces all workshops in the Series and provides high-level answers to questions such as:\n\nWhat are the differences among Python plotting libraries – Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Vega-Altair, and Plotnine – and when should you choose one over another?\nWhy use ParaView for 3D scientific visualization, and what are its core capabilities?\nIn what ways can you use Python scripting in ParaView? (There is more than one!)\nWhat are the three primary approaches to creating animations in ParaView?\nWhat is in-situ visualization?\nAny domain-specific visualization tools covered in this Series?\nWhich scientific web visualization tools should you consider using in 2026?\n\nWe will also briefly cover tools not included in this Series, such as VisIt, Python mapping packages, Julia plotting libraries, and others, and explain why they were left out.\nPDF slides\n\n\n\n\nJan-20, 11am PT – Plotting in Python with Matplotlib (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Yohai Meiron (Univ. of Toronto)\nAbstract: Matplotlib is the foundational plotting library for Python, and is widely used in tandem with other scientific libraries (such as NumPy and Pandas) to visualize data across many different fields. It is a free and open source software library that offers fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot, making it a powerful tool for customizing figures to meet specific needs. In this workshop, we will use a Jupyter notebook to show you how to create common 2D plot types such as line, scatter, and heatmaps, and how to customize the labels, legend, and panel layout. We will briefly touch on using Matplotlib to produce animations and interactive visualizations. By the end of this one-hours session, you will have a basic understanding of the library’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPython notebook (external link)   Notebook in PDF format\n\n\n\n\nJan-27, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Seaborn (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Jarno van der Kolk (Univ. of Ottawa)\nAbstract: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics and is particularly well suited for displaying multi-dimensional data to get quick insight in a dataset.\nPrerequisites: Some knowledge of Python.\nPython notebook (external GitHub repo)   Notebook in PDF format\n\n\n\n\nJan-30, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Plotly (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: Plotly is an open-source visualization library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs in Python (and other languages), with support for a wide range of plot types. In this workshop, you will learn two ways to use Plotly: the high-level Plotly Express interface for rapid data exploration, and the more flexible Plotly Graph Objects interface for detailed customization. We will explore common plot types – line, scatter, bar, pie, and heatmap – as well as more advanced and 3D visualizations. You will learn how to display figures using different rendering backends, save them as image or HTML files, and view them inside Jupyter notebooks. Finally, we will take a look at Plotly Dash, a framework for building interactive data web applications with sliders, buttons, dropdown menus and other interactive elements.\nPrerequisites: Some knowledge of Python.\nOnline notes\n\n\n\n\nFeb-03, 10am PT – Plotting in Python with Vega-Altair (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: How can you uncover the hidden trends in your thousands of data rows? This workshop teaches you how to create interactive charts from your tabular data. You’ll master histograms, time series plots, distributions, and multi-faceted graphs to transform your tables into impactful visualizations.\nOutline:\n\nCreating interactive charts with Altair\nBuilding a figure step-by-step using a grammar of graphics\nVisualizing time series and data distributions\nCreating multiple facets in a single figure\n\nSlides   GitHub repository\n\n\n\n\nFeb-06, 10am PT – Basic ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeakers: Alex Razoumov (SFU) and Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.) and Tyson Whitehead (Western Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView is an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed to run on a variety of hardware from individual laptops to large supercomputers. With ParaView, users can interactively visualize 2D and 3D datasets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles, animate these datasets over time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive visualization through a graphical user interface (GUI) and scripted visualization, including offscreen rendering, and is an easy and enjoyable tool to learn.\nIn this beginner’s workshop, we will explore ParaView’s interface, examine the types of data it can import, and learn how to use filters to build increasingly sophisticated visualization pipelines.\nPrerequisites: Please download and install ParaView v6.0 on your computer, and test that you can start ParaView before the workshop. We will provide all sample datasets.\nPDF slides   ZIP file with all ParaView slides and datasets\n\n\n\n\nFeb-10, 10am PT – The grammar of graphics in R and Python (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Tyson Whitehead (Western Univ.)\nAbstract: Most plotting packages offer a fixed set of built-in plot types to choose from. In contrast, the Grammar of Graphics defines a declarative framework for creating virtually unlimited visualizations by combining geometry, coordinate systems, facets, scales, guides, and themes. The most widely known implementation of this grammar is R’s ggplot2, with a lesser-known Python counterpart called Plotnine. This presentation introduces both libraries and demonstrates how the Grammar of Graphics can be used to build a wide range of plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides, scripts and data   PDF slides   Exploring Minard’s 1812 plot with ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nFeb-13, 10am PT – Introduction à ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView est un outil d’analyse et de visualisation de données à code source ouvert et multiplateforme, conçu pour fonctionner sur une variété de systèmes informatiques, des ordinateurs portatifs aux superordinateurs. Avec ParaView, on peut visualiser de manière interactive des ensembles de données 2D et 3D définis sur des particules ou des maillages structurés, adaptatifs ou non structurés. On peut ensuite animer ces données dans le temps et les manipuler à l’aide de divers filtres. ParaView prend en charge la visualisation interactive via une interface graphique, ainsi que la visualisation par script, y compris le rendu hors écran. C’est un outil facile et agréable à découvrir.\nDans cet atelier d’introduction, nous explorerons l’interface de ParaView, nous examinerons les types de données qu’il peut importer et nous apprendrons à utiliser des filtres pour construire des pipelines de visualisation de plus en plus sophistiqués.\nPrérequis: veuillez télécharger et installer le logiciel ParaView 6.0.1 sur votre ordinateur. Avant l’atelier, assurez-vous de pouvoir démarrer ParaView. Nous fournirons lors de la séance le matériel de formation.\nDiapositives (PDF)   Fichier ZIP contenant le matériel de formation\n\n\n\n\nFeb-24, 10am PT – ParaView scripting (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView’s Python library allows you to automate your visualization workflow by scripting your tasks and running them from the command line, either on your local machine or as a batch Slurm job on a remote HPC cluster, all without opening any windows. In this workshop, we will introduce ParaView’s Python tools, starting with using the Trace feature to convert GUI actions into scripts and then showing how to simplify and modify those scripts. You will learn how to run them using pvpython and pvbatch, and how to explore VTK data from the ParaView Python shell.\nPrerequisites: basic ParaView knowledge (importing and examining data, working with filters). To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nFeb-27, 10am PT – Scripter des visualisations via ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: La bibliothèque Python de ParaView vous permet d’automatiser votre processus de visualisation en programmant des séquences d’actions sous la forme de scripts et en les exécutant en ligne de commande, soit localement, soit via une tâche de calcul sur un superordinateur, le tout sans ouvrir aucune fenêtre de ParaView.\nCet atelier vous présentera les outils Python de ParaView, en commençant par l’utilisation de la fonction Trace pour convertir les actions de l’interface graphique en scripts, puis en vous montrant comment simplifier et modifier ces scripts. Vous apprendrez à les exécuter avec pvpython et pvbatch, et à explorer les données VTK depuis l’interpréteur Python de ParaView.\nPrérequis: connaissances de base de ParaView (importer et examiner des données, utiliser des filtres) et en programmation Python\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-03, 10am PT – ParaView animation (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView supports several approaches to animating data. In this session, we will focus on keyframe animation, where you can animate any property of any pipeline object, e.g. moving a slice through a volume by changing its origin, or animating a 2D contour through a 3D dataset by varying the contour value. We will also look at how to combine multiple timelines within a single animation. After that, we’ll work through several hands-on keyframe animation exercises and discuss how to create animations using Python scripting.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-06, 10am PT – Visualisations animées avec ParaView (FR)\n\n\nSpeaker: Pier-Luc St-Onge (McGill Univ.)\nAbstract: ParaView permet d’animer de différentes façons la visualisation de données. Cet atelier sera consacré à l’animation par images clés, soit une méthode permettant d’animer selon n’importe quelle propriété d’un objet du pipeline. Nous verrons, entre autres, comment animer le plan de coupe d’un volume et aussi comment animer un contour 2D, selon sa valeur, dans un jeu de données 3D. Nous verrons également comment combiner plusieurs chronologies au sein d’une même animation. Enfin, nous réaliserons plusieurs exercices pratiques d’animation par images clés et aborderons la création d’animations à l’aide de scripts Python.\nPrérequis: connaissances de base de ParaView (importer et examiner des données, utiliser des filtres) et la compréhension de scripts Python utilisant le module ParaView.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-10, 10am PT – Remote and large-scale visualization in ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: In this more advanced session, you will learn how to perform remote and large-scale visualization on the Alliance’s HPC clusters, for cases where you do not want to – or simply cannot – download the dataset to your local computer.\nSmall-scale remote visualization can be accomplished using JupyterHub or Open OnDemand, running either standalone ParaView or a ParaView client within a remote desktop environment.\nFor larger-scale interactive visualization, we will run a parallel ParaView server for data processing and rendering on a cluster and connect to it from a ParaView client on your local computer. This setup enables interactive visualization of very large datasets (multi-GB and potentially TB-scale) without transferring data locally, and without being limited by your own system’s memory or CPU/GPU resources.\nWe will explore workflows involving both time and camera animation. We will then save the interactive visualization pipeline as a script and run it remotely as a batch job on the cluster, performing all rendering off-screen (without opening any windows) to generate animation files.\nFinally, we will discuss strategies for optimizing data for parallel I/O and the compute resources required to process very large datasets.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions. You will also need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer, to be able to log in to the remote cluster. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-13, 10am PT – Introductory VMD (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Dmitri Rozmanov (Univ. of Calgary)\nAbstract: Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is a dedicated tool for visualizing, analyzing, and animating molecular structures such as proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes, that is often used to post-process molecular dynamics simulations. In this hands-on workshop, attendees will learn to navigate the VMD interface, apply diverse molecular representations, and utilize VMD’s selection language to isolate key residues or ligands. The session will also cover loading molecular dynamics trajectories and generating high-quality renderings suitable for publication. By the end of this workshop, participants will have the fundamental skills to transform raw atomic data into meaningful visual insights.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-17, 10am PT – Programmable Filter / Source in ParaView (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: ParaView includes two highly flexible scripting tools – the Programmable Filter and Programmable Source – that allow you to design your own data-processing operations. With them, you can construct entirely new spatial discretizations, generate tailored 3D structures, or even import data stored in custom file formats. This hands-on session will demonstrate how these features open up new possibilities for scientific visualization workflows.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-20, 10am PT – Network visualization with Gephi (EN)\n\n\nSpeakers: Jarno van der Kolk (Univ. of Ottawa)\nAbstract: Gephi is an open-source platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs. It lets you visualize how different entities connect with each other. These could be social media networks, researchers publishing papers, internet traffic and so on. It also has robust statistical analysis built-in.\nPrerequisites: Have Gephi installed. Downloads are available at https://gephi.org.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-24, 10am PT – In-situ visualization with ParaView’s Catalyst2 (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: As numerical simulations continue to grow in size and complexity, the I/O bottleneck makes it impossible to save all generated data for later analysis. In-situ techniques address this challenge by running analysis and visualization in real time, while the data are still in memory on the HPC system running the simulation, eliminating the need to write everything to disk. Several in-situ visualization frameworks exist, including ParaView’s Catalyst, VisIt’s LibSim, Ascent, and SENSEI.\nIn this hands-on workshop, we will focus on Catalyst2, which allows you to analyze and visualize your simulation data using familiar ParaView pipelines. Catalyst2 provides an API for describing and passing data arrays – computational meshes and fields – from your simulation to the library, which then converts these arrays into the appropriate VTK data structures. This happens without requiring the user to understand the underlying VTK data model and without duplicating data in memory. This framework is designed to scale to very large datasets and to thousands of CPU cores via MPI.\nThe goal of this workshop is to instrument a simple C code with the Catalyst2 library and produce in-situ outputs, including data extracts and rendered images, using ParaView’s Python scripting.\nPrerequisites: To participate in the hands-on exercises, please install ParaView on your computer. You can download it from the official website. Familiarity with ParaView basics – creating a visualization pipeline, applying filters, and scripting – is assumed and covered in earlier sessions. Some knowledge of C would be helpful, but we’ll take things step by step. You will also need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer, to be able to log in to the remote cluster. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster.\nAdd to your calendar\n\n\n\n\nMar-27, 10am PT – Modern tools for web visualization (EN)\n\n\nSpeaker: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nAbstract: We will begin with a brief overview of the history of general-purpose multidimensional web visualization, including the development of vtk.js and ParaViewWeb. The main focus of this hands-on workshop, however, is to teach you how to use Trame, an open-source framework for building interactive web applications and dashboards for data visualization. Trame leverages Python and popular visualization tools such as VTK and ParaView, and it offers plugins for many other Python plotting libraries.\nIn this session, we will introduce Trame’s core concepts, demonstrate how to create simple interactive visualizations, and show how to put them online for easy sharing. This workshop is ideal for researchers and data scientists who want to turn their static visualizations into interactive, shareable experiences without needing extensive web development expertise.\nAdd to your calendar"

It is built on top of numpy and the HDF5 scientific dataset library, and it focuses both on performance and interactive analysis of very large datasets. For large data streams (think multi-dimensional arrays or billions of records) it outperforms databases in terms of speed, memory usage and I/O bandwidth, although it is not a replacement to traditional relational databases as PyTables does not support broad relationships between dataset variables. PyTables can be even used to organize a workflow with many (thousands to millions) of small files, as you can create a PyTables database of nodes that can be used like regular opened files in Python. This lets you store a large number of arbitrary files in a PyTables database with on-the-fly compression, making it very efficient for handling huge amounts of data."

    "text": "(3) publish a dataset on GitHub with annexed files in a special private remote\nAt some stage, you might want to publish a dataset on GitHub that contains some annexed data. The problem is that annexed data could be large, and you can quickly run into problems with GitHub’s storage/bandwidth limitations. Moreover, free accounts on GitHub do not support working with annexed data.\nWith DalaLad, however, you can host large/annexed files elsewhere and still have the dataset published on GitHub. This is done with so-called special remotes. The published dataset on GitHub stores the information about where to obtain the annexed file contents when you run datalad get.\nSpecial remotes can point to Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, WebDAV, sftp servers, etc.\nLet’s create a small dataset with an annexed file:\ncd ~/tmp\nchmod -R u+wX publish && /bin/rm -r publish\n\ndatalad create --description \"published dataset\" -c text2git publish\ncd publish\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=test1 bs=1024 count=$(( RANDOM + 1024 ))\ndatalad save -m \"added test1\"\nNext, we can set up a special remote on the Alliance’s Nextcloud service. DataLad talks to special remotes via rclone protocol, so we need to install it (along with git-annex-remote-rclone utility) and then configure an rclone remote of type WebDAV:\nbrew install rclone\nbrew install git-annex-remote-rclone\nrclone config\n  new remote\n  Name: nextcloud\n  Type of storage: 46 / WebDAV\n  URL: https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/remote.php/webdav/\n  Vendor: 1 / Nextcloud\n  User name: razoumov\n  Password: type and confirm your password\n  no bearer_token\n  no advanced config\n  keep this remote\n  quit\nInside our dataset we set a nextcloud remote on which we’ll write into the directory annexedData:\ngit annex initremote nextcloud type=external externaltype=rclone encryption=none target=nextcloud prefix=annexedData\ngit remote -v\ndatalad siblings\ndatalad push --to nextcloud --data anything\nIf you want to share your annexedData folder with another CCDB user, log in to https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca with your CC credentials, click “share” on annexedData, then optionally type in the name/username of the user to share with.\nNext, we publish on dataset on GitHub. The following command creates an empty repository called testPublish on GitHub and sets a publication dependency: all new annexed content will automatically go to Nextcloud when we push to GitHub.\ndatalad create-sibling-github -d . testPublish --publish-depends nextcloud\ndatalad siblings   # +/- indicates the presence/absence of a remote data annex at this remote\ndatalad push --to github\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=test2 bs=1024 count=$(( RANDOM + 1024 ))\ndatalad save -m \"added test2\"\ndatalad push --to github   # automatically pushes test2 to nextcloud!\nImagine we are another user trying to download the dataset.

This means that we can implement a parallel loop for computing the sum. Let’s write parallelFor.jl with this version of the function:\nfunction slow(n::Int64, digitSequence::Int)\n    @time total = @distributed (+) for i in 1:n\n        !digitsin(digitSequence, i) ? 1.0 / i : 0\n    end\n    println(\"total = \", total);\nend\nA couple of important points:\n\nWe don’t need @everywhere to define this function. It is a parallel function defined on the control process, and running on the control process.\nThe only expression inside the loop is the compact if/else statement. Consider this:\n\n1==2 ? println(\"Yes\") : println(\"No\")\nThe outcome of the if/else statement is added to the partial sums at each loop iteration, and all these partial sums are added together.\nNow let’s measure the times:\n# slow(10, 9)\nprecompile(slow, (Int, Int))\nslow(Int64(1e8), 9)   # total = 13.277605949855722\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe two macros @btime and @distributed do not work nicely with each other. If you try to replace @time with @btime inside slow(), you will run into weird errors, so best to combine @distributed with @time when doing this in the same line. However, you can use @btime when calling the function:\nfunction slow(n::Int64, digitSequence::Int)\n    total = @distributed (+) for i in 1:n\n        !digitsin(digitSequence, i) ? 1.0 / i : 0\n    end\n    return(total)\nend\n@btime slow(Int64(1e8), 9)\nIn either case – whether using @time or @btime – we’ll get the single time for the entire parallel loop (1.498s in my case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise Distributed.6\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat on 8 CPU cores. Did your timing improve?\n\n\n\nI tested this code (parallelFor.jl) on Cedar with v1.5.2 and n=Int64(1e9):\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --ntasks=...   # number of MPI tasks\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --nodes=1-1   # change process distribution across nodes\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3600M\n#SBATCH --time=0:5:0\n#SBATCH --account=...\nmodule load julia\necho $SLURM_NODELIST\n# comment out addprocs() in the code\njulia -p $SLURM_NTASKS parallelFor.jl\n\n\n\nCode\nTime\n\n\n\n\nserial\n48.2s\n\n\n4 cores, same node\n12.2s\n\n\n8 cores, same node\n7.6s\n\n\n16 cores, same node\n6.8s\n\n\n32 cores, same node\n2.0s\n\n\n32 cores across 6 nodes\n11.3s\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3: use pmap to map arguments to processes\nThe pmap() function provides another mechanism to launch a function on all available workers:\n@everywhere function showid(message)   # define the function everywhere\n    println(message, myid())           # this function returns nothing\nend\nshowid(\"I am \")   # on control process\npmap(showid, [\"my id = \", \"and mine = \", \"reporting\", \"here we go: \"]);\nThere are two pmap() syntaxes:\npmap(slow, args)\npmap(x-&gt;x^2, [1,2,3,4])   # anonymous/lambda function\npmap(x-&gt;println(\"I am worker \", myid()), workers())\nLet’s apply this mapping tool to our slow series. We’ll start mappingArguments.jl with a new version of slow() that will compute partial sum on each worker:\n@everywhere function slow((n, digitSequence, taskid, ntasks))   # the argument is now a tuple\n    println(\"running on worker \", myid())\n    total = 0.0\n    @time for i in taskid:ntasks:n   # partial sum with a stride `ntasks`\n        !digitsin(digitSequence, i) && (total += 1.0 / i)   # compact if statement (similar to bash)\n    end\n    return(total)\nend\nand launch the function on each worker:\nslow((10, 9, 1, 1))   # package arguments in a tuple; serial run\nnw = nworkers()\nargs = [(Int64(1e8), 9, j, nw) for j in 1:nw]   # array of tuples to be mapped to workers\nprintln(\"total = \", sum(pmap(slow, args)))      # launch the function on each worker and sum the results\nWe see the following times from individual processes:\nFrom worker 2:  running on worker 2\nFrom worker 3:  running on worker 3\nFrom worker 4:  running on worker 4\nFrom worker 5:  running on worker 5\nFrom worker 2:    0.617099 seconds\nFrom worker 3:    0.619604 seconds\nFrom worker 4:    0.656923 seconds\nFrom worker 5:    0.675806 seconds\ntotal = 13.277605949854518\n\n\nHybrid parallelism\nHere is a simple example of a hybrid multi-threaded / multi-processing code contributed by Xavier Vasseur following the October 2021 workshop:\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using Base.Threads\n\n@everywhere function greetings_from_task(())\n    @threads for i=1:nthreads()\n    println(\"Hello from thread $(threadid()) on proc $(myid())\")\n    end\nend\n\nargs_pmap  = [() for j in workers()];\npmap(x-&gt;greetings_from_task(x), args_pmap)\nSave this code as hybrid.jl and then run it specifying the number of workers with -p and the number of threads per worker with -t flags:\n$ julia -p 4 -t 2 hybrid.jl\n    From worker 5:  Hello, I am thread 2 on proc 5\n    From worker 5:  Hello, I am thread 1 on proc 5\n    From worker 2:  Hello, I am thread 1 on proc 2\n    From worker 2:  Hello, I am thread 2 on proc 2\n    From worker 3:  Hello, I am thread 1 on proc 3\n    From worker 3:  Hello, I am thread 2 on proc 3\n    From worker 4:  Hello, I am thread 1 on proc 4\n    From worker 4:  Hello, I am thread 2 on proc 4\n\n\nOptional integration with Slurm\nClusterManagers.jl package lets you submit Slurm jobs from your Julia code. This way you can avoid writing a separate Slurm script in bash, and put everything (Slurm submission + parallel launcher + computations) into a single code. Moreover, you can use Julia as a language for writing complex HPC workflows, i.e. write your own distributed worflow manager for the cluster.\nHowever, for the types of workflows we consider in this workshop ClusterManagers.jl is an overkill, and we don’t recommend it for beginner Julia users.",

SharedArrays package is part of Julia’s Standard Library (comes with the language).\n\nSimilar to DistributedArrays, you can read elements using their global indices from any worker.\nUnlike with DistributedArrays, with SharedArrays you can write into any part of the array from any worker using their global indices. This makes it very easy to parallelize any serial code, but this comes with caveats.\n\nThere are downsides to SharedArray when compared to DistributedArrays.jl:\n\nThe ability to write into the same array elements from multiple processes creates the potential for a race condition and indeterminate outcome with a poorly written code!\nYou are limited to a set of workers on the same node – does SharedArrays predate DistributedArrays?\nYou will have very skewed (non-uniform across processes) memory usage.\n\nLet’s start with serial Julia (julia command) and initialize a 1D shared array:\nusing Distributed\naddprocs(4)\nusing SharedArrays    # important to run after adding workers\na = SharedArray{Float64}(30);\na[:] .= 1.0           # assign from the control process\n@fetchfrom 2 sum(a)   # correct (30.0)\n@fetchfrom 3 sum(a)   # correct (30.0)\nsum(a)                # correct (30.0)\n@sync @spawnat 2 a .= 2.0   # can assign from any worker!\n@fetchfrom 3 sum(a)         # correct (60.0)\na .= 3.0;                   # can assign from the control process as well\n@fetchfrom 2 sum(a)         # correct (90.0)\nYou can use a function to initialize an array, however, pay attention to the result:\nb = SharedArray{Int64}((1000), init = x -&gt; x .= 0);    # use a function to initialize `b`\nlength(b)\nb = SharedArray{Int64}((1000), init = x -&gt; x .+= 1)   # each worker updates the entire array in-place!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey idea\n\n\n\nEach worker runs this function!\n\n\nHere is another demo with a problem – let’s fill each element with its corresponding myid() value:\n@everywhere println(myid())     # let's use these IDs in the next function\nc = SharedArray{Int64}((20), init = x -&gt; x .= myid())   # indeterminate outcome! each time a new result\nEach worker updates every element, but the order in which they do this varies from one run to another, producing indeterminate outcome.\n\nAvoiding a race condition: use localindices\nWith a SharedArray, there is an implicit partitioning for processing on workers (although the array itself is stored on the control process):\n@everywhere using SharedArrays   # otherwise `localindices` won't be found on workers\nfor i in workers()\n    @spawnat i println(localindices(c))   # this block is assigned for processing on worker `i`\nend\nWhat we really want is for each worker to fill only its assigned block (parallel init, same result every time):\nc = SharedArray{Int64}((20), init = x -&gt; x[localindices(x)] .= myid())\n\n\nAnother way to avoid a race condition: use the parallel for loop\nLet’s initialize a 2D SharedArray:\na = SharedArray{Float64}(100,100);\n@distributed for i in 1:100   # parallel for loop split across all workers\n    for j in 1:100\n        a[i,j] = myid()       # ID of the worker that initialized this element\n    end\nend\nfor i in workers()\n    @spawnat i println(localindices(a))   # weird: shows 1D indices for 2D array\nend\nfor i in a[1:100,1]         # first element in each row\n    println(i)\nend\na[1:10,1:10]                # on the control process\n@fetchfrom 2 a[1:10,1:10]   # on worker 2",

    "text": "Parallelizing with multiple Unix processes (MPI tasks)\nJulia’s Distributed package provides multiprocessing environment to allow programs to run on multiple processors in shared or distributed memory. On each CPU core you start a separate Unix / MPI process, and these processes communicate via messages. Unlike in MPI, Julia’s implementation of message passing is one-sided, typically with higher-level operations like calls to user functions on a remote process.\n\na remote call is a request by one processor to call a function on another processor; returns a remote/future reference\nthe processor that made the call proceeds to its next operation while the remote call is computing, i.e. the call is non-blocking\nyou can obtain the remote result with fetch() or make the calling processor block with wait()\n\nIn this workflow you have a single control process + multiple worker processes. Processes pass information via messages underneath, not via variables in shared memory.\n\n\nLaunching worker processes\nThere are three different ways you can launch worker processes:\n\nwith a flag from bash:\n\njulia -p 8             # open REPL, start Julia control process + 8 worker processes\njulia -p 8 code.jl     # run the code with Julia control process + 8 worker processes\n\nfrom a job submission script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --ntasks=8\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3600M\n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00\n#SBATCH --account=def-someuser\nsrun hostname -s &gt; hostfile   # parallel I/O\nsleep 5\nmodule load julia/1.7.0\njulia --machine-file ./hostfile ./code.jl\n\nfrom the control process, after starting Julia as usual with julia:\n\nusing Distributed\naddprocs(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll three methods launch workers, so combining them will result in 16 (or 24!) workers – probably not the best idea. Select one method and use it.\n\n\nWith Slurm, methods (1) and (3) work very well, so—when working on a CC cluster—usually there is no need to construct a machine file.\n\n\nProcess control\nLet’s start an interactive MPI job:\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/julia/config/loadJulia.sh\nsalloc --mem-per-cpu=3600M --time=2:0:0 --ntasks=4\nInside this job, start Julia with julia (single control process).\nusing Distributed\naddprocs(4)   # add 4 worker processes; this might take a while on the training cluster\nprintln(\"number of processes = \", nprocs())   # control process + 4 workers\nprintln(\"number of workers = \", nworkers())   # 4 workers\nworkers()                                     # list worker IDs\nYou can easily remove selected workers from the pool:\nrmprocs(2, 3, waitfor=0)   # remove processes 2 and 3 immediately\nworkers()\nor you can remove all of them:\nfor i in workers()     # cycle through all workers\n    t = rmprocs(i, waitfor=0)\n    wait(t)            # wait for this operation to finish\nend\nworkers()\ninterrupt()   # will do the same (remove all workers)\naddprocs(4)   # add 4 new worker processes (notice the new IDs!)\nworkers()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDiscussion\n\n\n\nIf from the control process we start \\(N=8\\) workers, where will these processes run?

If we type:\na = 12\n@spawnat 2 println(a)     # will print 12 from worker 2\nit will do the following:\n\npass the namespace of local variables to worker 2\nspawn function execution on worker 2\nreturn a Future handle (referencing this running instance) to the control process\nreturn the REPL to the control process (while the function is running on worker 2), so we can continue running commands\n\nNow let’s modify our code slightly:\na = 12\n@spawnat 2 a+10          # Future returned but no visible calculation\nThere is no visible calculation happening; we need to fetch the result from the remote function before we can print it:\nr = @spawnat 2 a+10\ntypeof(r)\nfetch(r)                 # get the result from the remote function; this will pause\n                         #         the control process until the result is returned\nYou can combine both @spawnat and fetch() in one line:\nfetch(@spawnat 2 a+10)   # combine both in one line; the control process will pause\n@fetchfrom 2 a+10        # shorter notation; exactly the same as the previous command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise Distributed.1\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to define and run a function on one of the workers, e.g.\nfunction cube(x)\n    return x*x*x\nend\nHint: Use @everywhere to define the function on all workers. Julia may not have a high-level mechanism to define a function on a specific worker, short of loading that function as a module from a file.

Next, let’s run it on 3 (control + 2 workers) cores simultaneously:\n@everywhere using BenchmarkTools\n@everywhere @btime slow(Int64(1e8), 9)   # runs on 3 (control + 2 workers) cores simultaneously\nHere we are being silly: this code is serial, so each core performs the same calculation … I see the following times printed on my screen: 3.220s, 2.927s, 3.211s – each is from a separate process running the code in a serial fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we make this code parallel and faster?\n\n\nParallelizing our slow series: non-scalable version\nLet’s restart Julia with julia (single control process) and add 2 worker processes:\nusing Distributed\naddprocs(2)\nworkers()\nWe need to redefine digitsin() everywhere, and then let’s modify slow() to compute a partial sum:\n@everywhere function slow(n::Int, digitSequence::Int, taskid, ntasks)   # two additional arguments\n    println(\"running on worker \", myid())\n    total = 0.0\n    @time for i in taskid:ntasks:n   # partial sum with a stride `ntasks`\n        if !digitsin(digitSequence, i)\n            total += 1.0 / i\n        end\n    end\n    return(total)\nend\nNow we can actually use it:\n# slow(Int64(10), 9, 1, 2)   # precompile the code\nprecompile(slow, (Int, Int, Int, Int))\na = @spawnat :any slow(Int64(1e8), 9, 1, 2)\nb = @spawnat :any slow(Int64(1e8), 9, 2, 2)\nprint(\"total = \", fetch(a) + fetch(b))   # 13.277605949852546\nFor timing I got 1.30 s and 1.66 s, running concurrently, which is a 2X speedup compared to the serial run—this is great! Notice that we received a slightly different numerical result, due to a different order of summation.\nHowever, our code is not scalable: it is limited to a small number of sums each spawned with its own Future reference. If we want to scale it to 100 workers, we’ll have a problem.\nHow do we solve this problem—any idea before I show the solution in the next section?",

    "text": "In this section I will describe a project that you can work at home: the direct N-body solver.\nImagine that you place \\(N\\) identical particles randomly into a unit cube, with zero initial velocities. Then you turn on gravity, so that the particles start attracting each other. There are no boundary conditions: these are the only particles in the Universe, and they can fly to \\(\\infty\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat do you expect these particles will do?\n\n\nWe will adopt the following numerical method:\n\nforce evaluation via direct summation\nsingle variable (adaptive) time step: smaller \\(\\Delta t\\) when any two particles are close\ntime integration: more accurate than simple forward Euler + one force evaluation per time step\ntwo parameters: softening length and Courant number (I will explain these when we study the code)\n\nIn a real simulation, you would replace:\n\ndirect summation with a tree- or mesh-based \\(O(N\\log N)\\) code\ncurrent integrator with a higher-order scheme, e.g. Runge-Kutta\ncurrent timestepping with hierarchical particle updates\nfor long-term stable evolution with a small number of particles, use a symplectic orbit integrator\n\nExpected solutions:\n\n2 particles: should pass through each other, infinite oscillations\n3 particles: likely form a close binary + distant 3\\(^{\\rm rd}\\) particle (hierarchical triple system)\nmany particles: likely form a gravitationally bound system, with occasional ejection\n\nIn these clips below the time arrow is not physical time but the time step number. Consequently, the animations slow down when any two particles come close to each other.\n\n \n\nBelow you will find the serial code nbodySerial.jl. I removed all parts related to plotting the results, as it’s slow in Julia, and you would need to install Plots package (takes a while with many dependencies!).\nusing ProgressMeter\n\nnpart = 20\nniter = Int(1e5)\ncourant = 1e-3\nsofteningLength = 0.01\n\nx = rand(npart, 3);   # uniform [0,1]\nv = zeros(npart, 3);\n\nsoft = softeningLength^2;\n\nprintln(\"Computing ...\");\nforce = zeros(Float32, npart, 3);\noldforce = zeros(Float32, npart, 3);\n@showprogress for iter = 1:niter\n    tmin = 1.e10\n    for i = 1:npart\n        force[i,:] .= 0.\n        for j = 1:npart\n            if i != j\n                distSquared = sum((x[i,:] .- x[j,:]).^2) + soft;\n                force[i,:] -= (x[i, :] .- x[j,:]) / distSquared^1.5;\n                tmin = min(tmin, sqrt(distSquared / sum((v[i,:] .- v[j,:]).^2)));\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    dt = min(tmin*courant, 0.001);   # limit the initial step\n    for i = 1:npart\n        x[i,:] .+= v[i,:] .* dt .+ 0.5 .* oldforce[i,:] .* dt^2;\n        v[i,:] .+= 0.5 .* (oldforce[i,:] .+ force[i,:]) .* dt;\n        oldforce[i,:] .= force[i,:];\n    end\nend\nTring running this code with julia nbodySerial.jl; the main loop takes ~6m on the training cluster. Obviously, the most CPU-intensive part is force evaluation – this is what you want to accelerate.\nThere are many small arrays in the code – let’s use SharedArrays and fill them in parallel, e.g. you would replace\nforce = zeros(Float32, npart, 3);\nwith\nforce = SharedArray{Float32}(npart,3);\nWhen updating shared arrays, you have a choice: either update array[localindices(array)] on each worker, or use a parallel for loop with reduction. I suggest the latter. What do you want to reduce? Hint: what else do you compute besides the force in that loop? For code syntax, check parallelFor.jl code in this earlier section.\n\n\n\n\nResults\nWith default 20 particles and \\(10^5\\) steps the code runs slower in parallel on the training cluster:\n\n\n\nCode\nTime\n\n\n\n\njulia nbodySerial.jl (serial runtime)\n340s\n\n\njulia -p 1 nbodyDistributedShared.jl (2 processes)\n358s\n\n\n\nThis is the same problem we discussed in the Chapel course: with a fine-grained parallel code the communication overhead dominates the problem. As we increase the problem size, we should see the benefit from parallelization. E.g. with 1000 particles and 10 steps:\n\n\n\nCode\nTime\n\n\n\n\njulia nbodySerial.jl (serial runtime)\n83.7s\n\n\njulia -p 1 nbodyDistributedShared.jl (2 processes)\n47.9s\n\n\n\nHere is what I got on Cedar with 100 particles and \\(10^3\\) steps:\n\n\n\nRun\nTime\n\n\n\n\nserial\n1m23s\n\n\n2 cores\n46s\n\n\n4 cores\n29s\n\n\n8 cores\n22s\n\n\n16 cores\n18s\n\n\n32 cores\n19s",

    "text": "Advantages of Globus transfer over traditional scp/sftp/rsync\nIn April, we hosted a webinar “Introduction to Globus”. Here is a quick recap of why you might choose Globus over traditional file transfer tools:\n\nParallel, multi-stream transfers: Globus uses the GridFTP protocol with multiple TCP streams, tuning them for wide-area networks, which can dramatically outperform single-threaded scp or sftp. This makes it ideal for transferring large-scale (multi-GB and multi-PB) datasets where scp/sftp typically fail or crawl. In short, Globus will try to maximize bandwidth between any two endpoints.\nAutomatic retrying and resuming: If a transfer is interrupted (network drop, machine reboot, etc), Globus resumes where it left off without user intervention.\nChecksum verification.\nFile transfer happens in the background, i.e. you can close your laptop and the transfer continues server-to-server, unlike with scp/sftp where the session must stay open.\n\nyou’ll get an email notification when a task completes or fails\ncan also check status with interactive commands\n\nProvides logs, progress tracking, notifications, and retry logic automatically.\n\nmany research institutions use Globus for secure, auditable data movement that meets funding agency or privacy requirements\n\nYou can share data with collaborators who don’t have direct system accounts."

This could be used in scripting languages like Python and Ruby to integrate Globus into web portals.

You typically have read+write access to your own home/scratch/project directory mapped collection, but other Globus users don’t.\nGuest collections are shared subsets of mapped collections, can be shared with other Globus users without giving full system access.

    "section": "Starting up and authenticating",
    "text": "Starting up and authenticating\nIn Globus there are two levels of authentication.\n\nFirst, you need to log in to Globus itself:\n\n\nglobus login   # log in to a Globus session through your browser\nglobus whoami\nglobus whoami --verbose\nglobus session show   # show all active sessions\n# globus logout   # might run this at some point if you no longer need Globus\nOne person can have multiple Globus accounts, e.g. one with the Alliance, one with Google, one directly with Globus ID.\n\nSecond, when you access an endpoint (e.g. globus ls ..., globus transfer ...) inside a session, you will need to give Globus permission to access that endpoint / filesystem on your behalf. Theoretically, these “consents” can be managed via https://auth.globus.org/consents where you can see and revoke them individually. In practice I find it somewhat difficult to tell which endpoint is which (since it does not name them!), so the only way I can effectively use this site is by removing all existing consents.\n\nLet’s see how consents work in practice. We define a couple of Globus tutorial collections through their IDs:\nexport T1=6c54cade-bde5-45c1-bdea-f4bd71dba2cc   # provided by Globus\nexport T2=31ce9ba0-176d-45a5-add3-f37d233ba47d   # another mirror of the same collection\nglobus ls $T1\nIf this is your first time accessing this collection after globus login, you will likely get “The collection you are trying to access data on requires you to grant consent for the Globus CLI to access it” along with a suggested command to run:\nglobus session consent &lt;authentication_scope&gt;   # opens a browser page\nglobus ls $T1                      # empty\nglobus ls $T1:/home/share/godata   # three small files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFrom Globus manual\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Globus CLI is used to interact with a collection, it may find that it has not been granted sufficient permissions to access the collection. In these cases, the CLI will prompt you to run a login command to grant it the necessary consent.\nThere are also other cases, such as strict authentication policies, in which the CLI dynamically discovers requirements which require a new login flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInfinite authentication loop\n\n\n\nSometimes you might get stuck in an infinite authentication loop. After having logged into Globus, when trying to list or transfer files, if you are missing that endpoint’s consent, Globus should tell you to run a very specific command globus session consent &lt;authentication_scope&gt;. Sometimes, if some Globus machinery behind the scenes is not updated properly, you might get instead:\nThe resource you are trying to access requires you to re-authenticate with specific identities.\nmessage: Missing required data_access consent\nPlease use \"globus session update\" to re-authenticate with specific identities\nIf you follow this advice, you will get stuck in an infinite authentication loop. In my experience, waiting for a day or so should automatically resolve the problem. Alternatively, email us at globus@tech.alliancecan.ca to open a support ticket."

You can find some Web interface-specific details in our documentation https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus#Globus_sharing. You can share with individual Globus users and with groups. Here we’ll demo sharing with users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGetting your collaborator’s Globus userID\n\n\n\nYou will need your collaborator’s Globus userID to give them access. You can look it up yourself using their Globus username, e.g.\nglobus get-identities razoumov@computecanada.ca\nor you can ask them for it. They can look it up via the web interface:\n\nlog in to https://globus.alliancecan.ca\nSettings | Account | select Identity from the list | click the ↓ arrow to see your ID\n\nor in many different ways in the CLI:\nglobus get-identities &lt;collaboratorUserName&gt;\nglobus whoami --verbose | grep ID\nglobus session show\nE.g., when I run these commands myself, all three return the same useID. \n\n\nTo demo sharing, I will use my alternative Globus ID (log in via https://www.globus.org and organization = Globus ID):\nglobus get-identities razoumov@globusid.org                  # userName ⟹ userID\nglobus get-identities ae739fc4-d274-11e5-b957-ab0e5eadc80e   # userID ⟹ userName\n\nexport COLLABORATOR=ae739fc4-d274-11e5-b957-ab0e5eadc80e  # could be user or group ID\nexport FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantGuest collections inside GCP\n\n\n\nCreating guest collections on a Globus Connect Personal mapped collection is supported, but it requires a paid subscription. Without it, you cannot share files hosted on your own computer. See the details here. However, you can host a guest collection on a Globus Connect Server mapped collection on an Alliance cluster where we already have a subscription.\n\n\nYou can share your files stored on an Alliance cluster with any Globus user in the world, even if that user does not have an account on that cluster.\n\n/home – yes on all general-purpose clusters (not sure on Trillium)\n/scratch – yes on Beluga, Narval, Rorqual, no on other clusters\n/project – on PI’s request only (to prevent sharing other users’ files)\n\nHere we will create a guest collections on Fir’s /home and then we’ll share it with our collaborator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionRunning this workflow on the cluster\n\n\n\nAs of this moment, the default version of globus-cli on our clusters is slightly old, so the command globus collection create ... does not exist there. Therefore, you can either upgrade globus-cli in place yourself:\nsource ~/env-globus/bin/activate\nglobus version   # 3.2.0, latest is 3.38.0\nglobus update\nor you can run this workflow on your own computer where presumably you have the latest version installed.\n\n\nOn Fir, let’s create ~/share and place a file (e.g. noise.silo) there. In Globus, Fir is already registered as a Globus Connect Server v5 Mapped Collection, so you can create a new guest collection inside it:\nglobus collection create guest $FIR /home/razoumov/share project004   # create a new guest collection\nAt this point Globus might ask you to run globus login --gcs ... to verify who you are, and then you can rerun the command:\nglobus collection create guest $FIR /home/razoumov/share project004   # create a new guest collection\n# Display Name:                     project004\n# Owner:                            razoumov@computecanada.ca\n# ID:                               2342c760-b98b-40cc-b3f7-9550dce48c83\n# Collection Type:                  guest\n# ...\n# Public:                           True\n“Public” means that anyone with a Globus account can search for this collection with globus endpoint search project004, but they cannot see the files inside it. For file access, give your collaborator permission (r or rw) to access your collection, e.g. at its root level (that will point to ~/share):\nCOLLECTION=2342c760-b98b-40cc-b3f7-9550dce48c83\nglobus endpoint permission create --identity $COLLABORATOR --permissions rw $COLLECTION:/\n# Message: Access rule created successfully.\n# Rule ID: 228e0e90-a07f-11f0-b159-0affca67c55f\nIf instead you want to share with all logged-in Globus users:\nglobus endpoint permission create --permissions r --all-authenticated $COLLECTION:/\nIf you want to share with anyone (no login needed):\nglobus endpoint permission create --permissions r --anonymous $COLLECTION:/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep the permission’s ruleID, as you will need it later to modify/revoke access.\n\n\nAt this point your collaborator should be able to see the files inside your collection:\nglobus endpoint search project004   # if they have just the name =&gt; returns collectionID\nglobus ls 0a13e15f-4848-4b63-aa87-31202640eff4   # should see noise.silo\nand transfer files (download with r and download/upload with rw permissions) with globus transfer ... or via the web interface.\nSince this is your own collection, you should be able to use it as well, e.g. – after starting Globus Connect Personal – you can transfer files between this collection and your computer:\nexport LAPTOP=f81086c2-a870-11f0-bd08-027493648695\nglobus transfer $COLLECTION:noise.silo $LAPTOP:tmp/n.silo   # download a file\ndate &gt; ~/tmp/test.txt\nglobus transfer $LAPTOP:tmp/test.txt $COLLECTION:/test.txt   # upload a file\nor, after adding “project004” to the gcp() shell function:\ngcp project004:noise.silo laptop:tmp/n.silo    # download a file\ngcp laptop:tmp/test.txt project004:/test.txt   # upload a file\nAfter your project is done, you might want to remove permissions:\nglobus endpoint permission list $COLLECTION   # show all permissions for this collection with ruleIDs\nglobus endpoint permission delete $COLLECTION 228e0e90-a07f-11f0-b159-0affca67c55f   # collectionID ruleID\nand eventually delete the guest collection:\nglobus collection delete $COLLECTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionDelete order\n\n\n\nIf you delete the collection before removing its permissions, the permissions will get orphaned, and you will still see them listed (without ruleIDs) for any future collections created with the same shared directory – I don’t know how to delete these permissions in this case. Therefore, make sure to delete any associated permissions before deleting the collection."

We have 1 virtual GPU on the training cluster to share among all participants and the instructor, so we won’t be able to use it all at the same time. The idea is to try your final production code on this GPU allocating it only for a couple of minutes at a time per user:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=00:02:00\n#SBATCH --mem=3600\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1\nnvidia-smi\nchpl --fast test.chpl\n./test\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/syncHPC/startSingleLocaleGPU.sh\nsbatch submit.sh\n\nWe will be doing most debugging on CPUs using the so-called ‘CPU-as-device’ mode to run a GPU code on a CPU. This is very handy for debugging a Chapel GPU code on a computer without a dedicated GPU and/or vendor SDK installed. You can find more details on this mode here. To enable this mode, I recompiled Chapel with export CHPL_GPU=cpu, but you need to load this version of Chapel separately, and you can use it via an interactive job:\n\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/syncHPC/startSingleLocaleCPUasDevice.sh\nsalloc --time=2:0:0 --mem=3600\nchpl --fast test.chpl\n./test\nIn this mode there are some restrictions, e.g. data movement between the device and the host will not be captured (as there are no data moved!), some parallel reductions might not be available in this mode (to be confirmed), and the GPU kernel breakdown might be different. Still, all GPU kernels will be launched on the CPU, and you can even use some of the Chapel’s diagnostic features in this mode, e.g. @assertOnGpu and @gpu.assertEligible attributes will fail at compile time for ineligible loops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease do not start nested Slurm jobs.

You can move the definition of stability to the host, and then the code with plotting on the CPU will work. However, plotting a large heatmap can really benefit from GPU acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Port plotting to a GPU\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a take-home exercise: try porting this plotting block to a GPU. On my side, I am running into an issue assigning to a tuple element on a GPU with\ncolour[i,j] = ((cmap[idx,1]*255):int, (cmap[idx,2]*255):int, (cmap[idx,3]*255):int);\ngetting a runtime “Error calling CUDA function: an illegal memory access was encountered (Code: 700)”. Image library is still marked unstable, so perhaps this is a bug. No issues running my code on ‘CPU-as-device’.\nIf you succeed in running this block on a real GPU, please send me your solution."

Bash is the most commonly used Linux shell, which you will use by default on most Alliance hardware. Although we teach Bash basics in various online schools and in-person workshops many times a year, there are some useful Bash features and tricks that we never get to teach, due to our usual time constraints. Finally we can share some of them with you in this webinar!\nIn this presentation, we talk about running commands in a subshell, subsetting string variables, Bash arrays, modifying separators with IFS, running Python code from inside self-contained Bash functions, editing your command history, running unaliased versions of commands, handy use of brace expansion, and a few other topics."

Imagine you want to process some files in a loop:\nunset IFS\ntouch \"my thesis.md\" \"first results.md\"   # really bad idea, but 99% of people do it anyway\nfor i in *.md; do     # the wildcard gets expanded here into a string with 2 items =&gt; 2 loop iterations\n    ls -l $i          # $i is a string with space; this gives an error, as `ls` sees this string as 2 names\n    mv $i ${i/.md/.tex}   # this gives an error too, as `mv` sees each string as 2 names\ndone\nThis would be a bad way to fix this:\nfor i in \"*.md\"; do   # loop over one element (the string with *.md inside) =&gt; 1 loop iteration\n    ls -l $i          # $i contains a wildcard that gets expanded here; `ls -l` over 2 items =&gt; works\n    mv $i ${i/.md/.tex}   # 1st wildcat gets expanded into 2 items, 2nd wildcard does not get expanded =&gt; error\ndone\nA good way to fix this:\nfor i in *.md; do   # the wildcard gets expanded here into a string with 2 items =&gt; 2 loop iterations\n    ls -l \"$i\"      # `ls` acts on a string inside the quotes =&gt; works\n    mv \"$i\" \"${i/.md/.tex}\"   # `mv` acts on 2 strings inside the quotes =&gt; works\ndone\nOr you can do this with IFS, without having to use quotes:\n/bin/rm *.tex\ntouch \"my thesis.md\" \"first results.md\"   # really bad idea, but 99% of people do it anyway\nIFS=$'\\n\\t'   # more restrictive IFS\nfor i in *.md; do\n    ls -l $i\n    mv $i ${i/.md/.tex}\ndone\nYou can specifically use a newline character as a separator. Let’s create a file and prepend each line with the character count in that line:\necho first line &gt; a.txt\necho second line &gt;&gt; a.txt\ncat a.txt\n\nunset IFS\nfor w in $(cat a.txt); do    # counts characters in individual words\n    echo ${#w} $w\ndone\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor w in $(cat a.txt); do    # counts characters in individual lines\n    echo ${#w} $w\ndone\nOf course, there are always alternative solutions without IFS, e.g.\ncat a.txt | while read line\n    do\n    echo ${#line} $line\ndone\nIFS can work with arrays too, but you have to be careful, as an array will always break between elements, no matter the value of IFS. With IFS set, it will break at the IFS characters and between elements.\na=(102030 hello there \"hi there\")\nunset IFS\nfor x in ${a[@]}; do     # breaks at spaces and between elements\n  echo $x\ndone\nfor x in \"${a[@]}\"; do   # breaks between elements\n  echo $x\ndone\nIFS=$'\\n\\t'\nfor x in ${a[@]}; do     # breaks between elements\n  echo $x\ndone\nIFS=\"0\"\nfor x in ${a[@]}; do     # breaks at 0 and between elements\n  echo $x\ndone\n\n\nPython inside self-contained bash functions\nThe operator &lt;&lt; – called here-document structure in bash – is used to pass some text input along with its ending pattern to a program, e.g.\nwc -l &lt;&lt; EOF\nline 1\nline 2\nEOF\nYou can save this input to a file:\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; b.txt\nline 1\nline 2\nEOF\nYou can use this mechanism to define some Python code inside a bash function:\nfunction pi() {\n    cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; uniqueCode.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport math as m\nprint(m.pi)\nEOF\n    chmod 700 uniqueCode.py\n    ./uniqueCode.py\n    /bin/rm uniqueCode.py\n}\nHere is a useful example:\nfunction extractEmails() {\n    cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; uniqueCode.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys, re\nfilename = open(sys.argv[1], \"r\")\ncontent = filename.readlines()\nemails = []\nfor i, line in enumerate(content):\n    email = re.findall(r'[\\w.+-]+@[\\w-]+\\.[\\w.-]+', line)\n    if len(email) &gt; 0 and \"...\" not in email[0]:\n        for e in email:\n            emails.append(e)\nprint(', '.join(map(str, emails)))   # print all emails in a single line without quotes\nEOF\n    chmod 700 uniqueCode.py\n    ./uniqueCode.py $1\n    /bin/rm uniqueCode.py\n}\ncat contact.txt\nextractEmails contact.txt"

    "text": "Second part (Marie)\n\nFix commands\nThe builtin utility fc (“fix command”) allows to rerun or edit and rerun previous commands. This is particularly useful if you made a typo in a long command or a series of commands. It is also convenient if you want to rerun a series of commands.\nWithout any flag, fc will open your default text editor with the last command for you to edit. After saving and exiting your editor, the edited command will run.\nWith flags, you can:\n\nlist previous commands (they will be numbered): fc -l,\nopen a particular command from that list in your editor: fc &lt;number&gt;,\nopen all commands between &lt;number1&gt; and &lt;number2&gt; in your editor (they will all rerun once you save and close): fc &lt;number1&gt; &lt;number2&gt;,\nre-execute the last command with fc -s,\nre-execute a particular command without edit: fc -s &lt;number&gt;,\nre-execute all commands between &lt;number1&gt; and &lt;number2&gt; without edit: fc -s &lt;number1&gt; &lt;number2&gt;.\n\nAdditionally, you can specify the editor with the -e flag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExamples:\n\n\n\nfc           # open last command with default editor to edit, then rerun\nfc -e emacs  # open last command with Emacs to edit, then rerun\n\nfc -l        # list past commands (they will be numbered)\nfc 34 38     # open default editor with commands number 34 to 38 to edit, then rerun\n\nfc -s 54     # rerun command number 54 without edit\n\n\n\n\nQuick substitution\nStill on the subject of fixing commands, if you want to rerun your last command with a substitution (e.g. you made a typo in the last command and you want to re-run it without the typo, or you are running a second similar command), you could recall the last command with C-p and navigate to the part that needs changing or you could run fc and do the same in your editor.\nBut there is a much faster method: the quick substitution of old by new simply by typing: ^old^new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nI already ran echo This is a test. Now, if I run ^test^cool test, it will actually run the command:\necho This is a cool test\n\n\n\n\nEasy access to unaliased versions of commands\nIf you have created aliases which use the names of Bash commands, calling those commands will call the aliases. You may however occasionally need to use the non-aliased commands.\nOne way to do this is to unalias your alias with unalias &lt;command&gt;. But then, you have lost your alias for the rest of your session or until you resource your .bashrc file.\nAnother option is to use the full path of the command (e.g. /usr/bin/&lt;command&gt;). If you don’t know the path of the command, you can find it with which &lt;command&gt;.\nStill, there is an even easier method: simply prepend your alias with \\.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nI have an alias called ls for ls --color. I can check this by typing any of:\nalias ls\ntype ls\nI can run the original ls command without loosing my alias and without bothering with the full path of ls with:\n\\ls\n\n\n\n\nDetermine file types\nThe command file runs tests to determine the types of files based on their content (thus independently of any extension(s)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOutput examples\n\n\n\ndirectory                                                            # directory\n\nsymbolic link to &lt;/some/path&gt;                                        # symlink\n\nPOSIX shell script, ASCII text executable                            # executable shell script\nPython script, ASCII text executable                                 # executable Python script\nPerl script text executable                                          # executable Perl script\n\nASCII text                                                           # text file\n\nempty                                                                # empty file\n\nPDF document, version 1.4                                            # .pdf\nPDF document, version 1.7 (zip deflate encoded)                      # .pdf\n\nGit index, version 2, 208 entries                                    # index in .Git repository\n\nGNU dbm 1.x or ndbm database, little endian, 64-bit                  # .db database\n\nZstandard compressed data (v0.8+)                                    # .zst compressed file\ngzip compressed data, was \"&lt;file&gt;.tar\", last modified: \\\n     Wed Feb 28 09:25:16 2007, \\\n     from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT), \\\n     original size modulo 2^32 24064                                 # .tar.gz compressed archive\n\nMPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, JntStereo              # .mp3 sound\nMPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo                 # .mp3 sound\nMPEG ADTS, layer III v1, 96 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Monaural                 # .mp3 sound\nFLAC audio bitstream data, 16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz, 7670460 samples # .flack sound\nMicrosoft ASF                                                        # .wma sound\n\nPNG image data, 665 x 742, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced          # .png image\nGIMP XCF image data, version 011, 161 x 157, RGB Color               # .xcf GIMP file\nSVG Scalable Vector Graphics image                                   # .svg image\nGIF image data, version 89a, 160 x 40                                # .gif image\n\nEPUB document                                                        # .epub book\nDjVu multiple page document                                          # .djvu book\n\n\nFor some file types, you get a lot more information.

    "section": "Loosely coupled parallel problem",
    "text": "Loosely coupled parallel problem\nWhen I teach parallel computing in other languages (Julia, Chapel), the approach is to take a numerical problem and parallelize it using multiple processors, and concentrate on various issues and bottlenecks (variable locks, load balancing, false sharing, messaging overheads, etc.) that lead to less than 100% parallel efficiency. For the numerical problem I usually select something that is very simple to code, yet forces the computer to do brute-force calculation that cannot be easily optimized.\nOne such problem is a slow series. It is a well-known fact that the harmonic series \\(\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\infty{1\\over k}\\) diverges. It turns out that if we omit the terms whose denominators in decimal notation contain any digit or string of digits, it converges, albeit very slowly (Schmelzer & Baillie 2008), e.g.\n\nBut this slow convergence is actually good for us: our answer will be bounded by the exact result (22.9206766192…) on the upper side, and we will force the computer to do CPU-intensive work. We will sum all the terms whose denominators do not contain the digit “9”, and evaluate the first \\(10^8\\) terms.\nI implemented and timed this problem running in serial in Julia (356ms) and Chapel (300ms) – both are compiled languages. Here is one possible Python implementation:\nfrom time import time\ndef slow(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = slow(100_000_000)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nLet’s save this code inside the file slowSeries.py and run it. Depending on the power supplied to my laptop’s CPU (which I find varies quite a bit depending on the environment), I get the average runtime of 6.625 seconds. That’s ~20X slower than in Julia and Chapel!\nNote that for other problems you will likely see an even bigger (100-200X) gap between Python and the compiled languages. In other languages looking for a substring in a decimal representation of a number takes a while, and there you will want to code this calculation using integer numbers. If we also do this via integer operations in Python:\ndef digitsin(num: int):\n    base = 10\n    while 9//base &gt; 0: base *= 10\n    while num &gt; 0:\n        if num%base == 9: return True\n        num = num//10\n    return False\n\ndef slow(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        if not digitsin(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\nour code will be ~3-4X slower, so in the native Python code we should use the first version of the code with if not \"9\" in str(i) – it turns out that in this particular case Python’s high-level substring search is actually quite well optimized!\n\nSpeeding up the slow series with Numba\nYou can speed up this problem with an open-source just-in-time compiler called Numba. It uses LLVM underneath, can parallelize your code for multi-core CPUs and GPUs, and often requires only minor code changes.\nI won’t go through all the Numba details – we cover these in our separate HPC Python course. To speed up the slow series with Numba, you have to use the integer-operations version of digitsin(), as Numba is notoriously slow with some high-level Python constructs. Check out this implementation which is almost as fast as with the compiled languages:\nfrom time import time\nfrom numba import jit\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef combined(k):\n    base, k0 = 10, k\n    while 9//base &gt; 0: base *= 10\n    while k &gt; 0:\n        if k%base == 9: return 0.0\n        k = k//10\n    return 1.0/k0\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef slow(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        total += combined(i)\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = slow(100_000_000)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nIt finishes in 0.601 seconds, i.e. ~10X faster than a naive Numba implementation with substring search (not shown here).\n\n\nRunning Numba-compiled functions as Ray tasks\nWouldn’t it be great if we could use Ray to distribute execution of Numba-compiled functions to workers? It turns out we can, but we have to be careful with syntax. We would need to define remote compiled functions, but neither Ray, nor Numba let you combine their decorators (@ray.remote and @numba.jit, respectively) for a single function. You can do this in two steps:\nimport ray\nfrom numba import jit\n\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef square(x):\n    return x*x\n\n@ray.remote\ndef runCompiled():\n    return square(5)\n\nr = runCompiled.remote()\nray.get(r)\nHere we “jit” the function on the main process and send it to workers for execution. Alternatively, you can “jit” on workers:\nimport ray\nfrom numba import jit\n\nray.init(num_cpus=4, configure_logging=False)\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x*x\n\n@ray.remote\ndef runCompiled():\n    compiledSquare = jit(square)\n    return compiledSquare(5)\n\nr = runCompiled.remote()\nray.get(r)\nIn my tests with more CPU-intensive functions, both versions produce equivalent runtimes.\nHere is the combined Numba + Ray remotes code for the slow series (store it as slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py):\nfrom time import time\nimport ray\nfrom numba import jit\n\nray.init(configure_logging=False)\n\nn = 100_000_000\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef combined(x):\n    base, x0 = 10, x\n    while 9//base &gt; 0: base *= 10\n    while x &gt; 0:\n        if x%base == 9: return 0.0\n        x = x//10\n    return 1.0/x0\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef slow(interval):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(interval[0],interval[1]+1):\n        total += combined(i)\n    return total\n\n@ray.remote\ndef runCompiled(interval):\n    return slow(interval)\n\nncores = 4\nsize = n//ncores   # size of each batch\nintervals = [(i*size+1,(i+1)*size) for i in range(ncores)]\nif n &gt; intervals[-1][1]: intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], n)   # add the remainder (if any)\n\nr = [runCompiled.remote((1,10)) for i in range(ncores)]   # expose workers to runCompiled function\ntotal = sum(ray.get(r))\n\nstart = time()\nr = [runCompiled.remote(intervals[i]) for i in range(ncores)]\ntotal = sum(ray.get(r))   # compute total sum\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nHere the averaged (over three runs) times on my laptop:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n0.439\n0.235\n0.130\n0.098\n\n\n\nUsing a combination of Numba and Ray tasks on 8 cores, we accelerated the calculation by ~68X.\n\n\nRunning on one cluster node\nLet’s run this Numba + Ray remotes code on several CPU cores on one cluster node. We documented this in our wiki https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Ray – look for the section “Single Node”. It advises you to start a single-node Ray cluster with multiple CPUs via the ray start ... command.\nStrictly speaking, you don’t have to do this, as Slurm will ensure that any additional processes spawned to run your Ray tasks will run on the allocated CPUs.\ntraining cluster\ncd ~/webinar\nmodule load StdEnv/2023 python/3.12.4 arrow/17.0.0 scipy-stack/2024a netcdf/4.9.2\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/pythonhpc-env/bin/activate\n\nsalloc --time=0:60:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ncores = 1\npython slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py   # 1.04s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ncores = 4\npython slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py   # 1.135s (still running on 1 core)\nexit\n\nsalloc --time=0:60:0 --ntasks=4 --mem-per-cpu=3600\npython slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py   # 0.264s (running on 4 cores)\nexit\nOn this training cluster we have 8 cores per node, so we can attempt to use all of them on a single node:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ncores = 8\nsalloc --time=0:60:0 --ntasks-per-node=8 --nodes=1 --mem-per-cpu=3600\npython slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py   # 0.135 (running on 8 cores)\nexit\n\n\nRunning on multiple cluster nodes\nNow let’s run the same problem on 2 cluster nodes. We’ll try to distribute these 8 workers across 8 cores across 2 nodes:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ncores = 8\nsalloc --time=0:60:0 --ntasks-per-node=4 --nodes=2 --mem-per-cpu=3600\npython slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py   # 0.292 (not getting 8X speedup)\nThe problem is that Ray cluster ran all 8 workers on 4 cores on the first node. While still inside the same job, let start an interactive Python shell and then type:\nimport ray\nray.init(num_cpus=8, configure_logging=False)\nray.nodes()   # reports a dictionary with node specs\nprint(len(ray.nodes()))   # 1 node\nprint(ray.cluster_resources().get(\"CPU\"))   # 8 CPU \"cores\"\nSo, we have 1 node in Ray … Ray thinks it has access to 8 CPU cores, but that’s actually the number of workers running on 4 physical CPU cores …\nTo run properly on 2 cluster nodes, we need to (1) start a single-node Ray cluster and then (2) add workers on other nodes to it outside of Python. This is described in our documentation https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRay does not play nicely with single-core MPI tasks. Internally, Ray thinks that each MPI rank should be a “Ray node”, inside of which you would utilize multiple CPU cores. We can do this by launching just one MPI rank per cluster node and then specifying --cpus-per-task=4.\n\n\nLet’s do it:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; make sure to go back to the login node!\nsalloc --time=0:60:0 --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem-per-cpu=3600\n\nexport HEAD_NODE=$(hostname)   # store head node's address\nexport RAY_PORT=34567          # choose a port to start Ray on the head node; unique from other users\n\necho \"Starting the Ray head node at $HEAD_NODE\"\nray start --head --node-ip-address=$HEAD_NODE --port=$RAY_PORT \\\n          --num-cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --block &\nsleep 10\n\necho \"Starting the Ray worker nodes on all other MPI tasks\"\nsrun launchWorkers.sh &\n\nray status   # should report 2 nodes (their IDs) and 8 cores\nHere is our code launchWorkers.sh to launch Ray workers on other nodes:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [[ \"$SLURM_PROCID\" -ne \"0\" ]]; then\n    ray start --address \"${HEAD_NODE}:${RAY_PORT}\" --num-cpus=\"${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}\" --block\n    sleep 5\n    echo \"ray worker started!\"\nfi\nStart Python and type:\nimport ray\nimport os\n\n# connect to our pre-configured Ray cluster\nray.init(address=f\"{os.environ['HEAD_NODE']}:{os.environ['RAY_PORT']}\",_node_ip_address=os.environ['HEAD_NODE'])\n\nprint(\"Nodes in the Ray cluster:\")\nprint(len(ray.nodes()))   # should report 2 nodes\nprint(ray.nodes())        # their details\n\nnodes = ray.nodes()\nfor node in nodes:\n    status = \"Alive\" if node['Alive'] else \"Dead\"\n    print(node['NodeID'], node['NodeManagerAddress'], status, int(node['Resources']['CPU']), \"cores\")\n\nprint(ray.available_resources())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this setup, each Ray node runs on a separate MPI task, one task per cluster node, and multiple CPU cores inside that task.\n\n\nLet’s go back to our slow series with Numba. We’ll start from scratch and run the job via sbatch.\nStep 1: Prepare the following submit.sh job submission script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3600\n#SBATCH --time=0:5:0\n\nmodule load StdEnv/2023 python/3.12.4 arrow/17.0.0 scipy-stack/2024a netcdf/4.9.2\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/pythonhpc-env/bin/activate\n\nexport HEAD_NODE=$(hostname)   # head node's address\nexport RAY_PORT=34567          # port to start Ray on the head node; should be unique\n\necho \"Starting the Ray head node at $HEAD_NODE\"\nray start --head --node-ip-address=$HEAD_NODE --port=$RAY_PORT \\\n          --num-cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --block &\nsleep 10\n\necho \"Starting the Ray worker nodes on all other MPI tasks\"\nsrun launchWorkers.sh &\n\npython slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py\nStep 2: Prepare the following launchWorkers.sh script:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [[ \"$SLURM_PROCID\" -ne \"0\" ]]; then\n    ray start --address \"${HEAD_NODE}:${RAY_PORT}\" --num-cpus=\"${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}\" --block\n    sleep 5\n    echo \"ray worker started!\"\nfi\nStep 3: In the code slowSeriesNumbaRayCore.py connect to the existing Ray cluster:\nimport os\nray.init(address=f\"{os.environ['HEAD_NODE']}:{os.environ['RAY_PORT']}\",_node_ip_address=os.environ['HEAD_NODE'])\nRun it with:\nsbatch submit.sh\nRunning it multiple times, I got the following runtimes: 0.188s, 0.208s, 0.153s – these are better than a 4-core, single-node run (0.292s), but worse than an 8-core, single-node run (0.135s). Any idea why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor longer runtimes, while your job is still running, you can ssh into individual nodes and check Ray’s CPU usage with htop --filter \"ray::\"\n\n\n\n\nAlternative parallel implementation via Ray Data\nIn addition to bare-bones remote functions, Ray provides other tools for parallelizing your calculations. For example, you can use Ray Data to process a table of rows in parallel. We won’t go into the details here – again, these are covered in our HPC Python course – here I will provide an example of parallelizing the slow series with Ray Data without Numba compilation:\nimport ray\nfrom time import time\n\ndef slow(row):   # this function processes a row in the dataset\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(row['a'], row['b']+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    row['sum'] = total\n    return row\n\nn = 100_000_000\nncores = 2\nray.init(num_cpus=ncores, configure_logging=False)\nsize = n // ncores\nedges = [(i*size+1, i*size+size) for i in range(ncores)]\nif edges[-1][1] &lt; n: edges[-1] = (edges[-1][0],n)\n\nintervals = ray.data.from_items([{'a':w[0], 'b':w[1]} for w in edges])  # define the dataset\n\nstart = time()\npartial = intervals.map(slow)                     # define the calculation\ntotal = sum([p['sum'] for p in partial.take()])   # request the result =&gt; start the calculation on 2 CPU cores\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nOf course, you can speed up this code a lot by running Numba-compiled slow() via Ray Data – do this as exercise after the webinar, or attend our HPC Python course."

    "text": "Tightly coupled parallel problem\nWe’ll be solving a 1D Poisson equation\n\\[{\\partial^2 u(x)\\over\\partial x^2}=\\rho(x)\\] on a unit interval \\(x\\in[0,1]\\). If we set \\(\\rho(x)\\equiv 2\\) and \\(u(0)=u(1)=0\\), the exact solution becomes \\(u(x)=x^2-x\\).\n\nMy original intention for this part of the webinar was to solve this problem via an iterative Schwarz linear solver. In this approach you divide the linear problem into ncores linear problems, each solved with np.linalg.solve() on a separate Ray task. At the end of each iteration you update the first and the last elements of the RHS vector in each linear system with the new solutions at the interfaces.\nHowever, a naive implementation of this solver converges very slowly. You can speed it up by using a staggered linear solver (to accelerate the convergence rate) and pre-computing the coarser solution in serial (to be used as the initial iteration for the finer solution). When you implement these techniques, the 1D parallel solver converges in 3 iterations, which (1) defies the purpose of breaking it up into multiple parts to be parallelized with Ray, and (2) will take a while to explain and code in this webinar which is not on the theory of parallel linear solvers.\nFor this reason, here I will show a brute-force iterative solution to this problem. It is much less efficient, but it will work well here to demonstrate a tightly coupled parallel solver with Ray.\nWe can rewrite the above equation in the finite difference form:\n\\[\n{u_{i-1}-2u_i+u_{i+1}\\over h^2}=\\rho_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(i\\) is the grid index. Starting with the initial guess \\(u_i^0=0\\), we can set up iterations to compute the solution:\n\\[\nu_i^{n+1} = {u_{i-1}^n+u_{i+1}^n-b_i\\over 2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(b_i=\\rho_ih^2\\), and the solution converges as \\(n\\to\\infty\\).\n\nSerial code\nTo prototype a parallel solver, first we’ll write a serial code that solves the problem on 2 intervals, and later we’ll parallelize it. We’ll do all array computations with NumPy. Let’s consider a fairly large 1D problem (total number of inner grid points \\(N=2\\times10^7\\)) and break it into 2 intervals.\n\n\nupdate the solution only at the inner points (filled circles)\nalways have \\(u_0=u_{N-1}=0\\) at the edges (large open circles)\nexchange values at the inner boundary (large filled circles)\n\nLet’s store this code in poissonSerial.py:\n##### this is poissonSerial.py #####\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\n\nn, relativeTolerance = 20_000_000, 1e-4\nn1 = n//2; n2 = n - n1\nh = 1/(n-1)\n\nb = np.ones(n)*2*h*h\n\nu1 = np.zeros(n1)   # the initial guess (first interval)\nu2 = np.zeros(n2)   # the initial guess (second interval)\n\ndiff = 999.0   # difference between two successive values of u1[-1]\ncount = 0\nstart = time()\nwhile abs(diff) &gt; relativeTolerance:\n    count += 1\n    ghostLeft = u1[-1]\n    ghostRight = u2[0]\n    diff = ghostLeft\n    # compute new u1\n    u1[1:n1-1] = (u1[0:n1-2] + u1[2:n1] - b[1:n1-1]) / 2   # update at inner points 1..n1-2\n    u1[n1-1] = (u1[n1-2] + ghostRight - b[n1-1]) / 2       # update at the last point\n    # compute new u2\n    u2[1:n2-1] = (u2[0:n2-2] + u2[2:n2] - b[n1+1:n-1]) / 2 # update at inner points 1..n2-2\n    u2[0] = (ghostLeft + u2[1] - b[n1]) / 2                # update at the first point\n    diff = (diff-u1[-1]) / u1[-1]\n    if count%100 == 0: print(u1[-3:], u2[:3], diff)\n\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(\"Converged after\", count, \"iterations\", \"with diff =\", diff)\nprint(\"Solution:\", u1[-3:], u2[:3])\npyenv activate hpc-env\ncd ~/training/pythonHPC/clusterWorkflows\npython poissonSerial.py\nTime in seconds: 279.032\nConverged after 9961 iterations with diff = -9.999348935138563e-05\nSolution: [-2.50966143e-11 -2.50990843e-11 -2.51015743e-11] [-2.51015743e-11 -2.50990843e-11 -2.50966143e-11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, we did not converge here (still very far from the exact solution \\(u(x)=x^2-x\\)) – but this is not important for our parallel scaling purposes.\n\n\n\n\nPersistent storage on Ray workers\nIn the previous serial code u1 and u2 are stored on the same processor. In the parallel code we’ll be computing u1 on processor 1 and u2 on processor 2. At each iteration we’ll be calling several Ray remote functions to do processing, but we need to store the solution u1 on processor 1 and u2 on processor 2 in between these function calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRay functions (remote tasks) are stateless, i.e. they can run on any processor that happens to be more idle at the time. How do we ensure that we always compute u1 on processor 1 and u2 on processor 2, and how do we store the arrays there permanently, without copying them back and forth at each iteration?\n\n\nTo do this, we need to use Ray actors (https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html). A Ray actor is essentially a stateful (bound to a processor) worker that is created via a Python class instance with its own persistent variables and methods, and it stays permanently on that worker until we destroy this instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\nclass ArrayStorage:         # define an actor (ArrayStorage class) with a persistent array\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.array = None   # persistent array variable\n    def store_array(self, arr):\n        self.array = arr    # store an array in the actor's state\n    def get_array(self):\n        return self.array   # retrieve the stored array\n\nstorage_actor = ArrayStorage.remote()   # create an instance of the actor\n\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nray.get(storage_actor.store_array.remote(arr))   # store an array\n\nr = ray.get(storage_actor.get_array.remote())    # retrieve the stored array\nprint(r)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]\n\n\n\n\nTo scale this to multiple workers, we can do the same with an array of workers:\nworkers = [ArrayStorage.remote() for i in range(2)]   # create two instances of the actor\n\nr = [workers[i].store_array.remote(np.ones(5)*(i+1)) for i in range(2)]\nprint(ray.get(r))\n\nprint(ray.get(workers[0].get_array.remote()))   # [1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]\nprint(ray.get(workers[1].get_array.remote()))   # [2. 2. 2. 2. 2.]\n\nr = [workers[i].get_array.remote() for i in range(2)]\nprint(ray.get(r))   # both arrays in one go\nIf we want to make sure that these arrays stay on the same workers, we can retrieve and print their IDs and the node IDs by adding these two functions to the actor class:\n...\n    def get_actor_id(self):\n        return self.actor_id\n    def get_node_id(self):\n        return self.node_id   # the node ID where this actor is running\n...\nprint([ray.get(workers[i].get_actor_id.remote()) for i in range(2)])   # actor IDs\nprint([ray.get(workers[i].get_node_id.remote()) for i in range(2)])    # node IDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even use NumPy on workers. For example, if we were to implement a linear algebra solver on a worker and wanted to have the solution array stored there permanently, we could do it this way:\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\nray.init(num_cpus=2, configure_logging=False)\n\nn = 500\nh = 1/(n+1)\nb = np.exp(-(100*(np.linspace(0,1,n)-0.45))**2)*h*h\n\n@ray.remote\nclass ArrayStorage:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.b = None   # persistent variable\n        self.u = None   # persistent variable\n        flatIdentity = np.identity(n).reshape([n*n])\n        a = -2.0*flatIdentity\n        a[1:n*n-1] = a[1:n*n-1] + flatIdentity[:n*n-2] + flatIdentity[2:]\n        self.a = a.reshape([n,n])   # persistent variable\n    def store_b(self, arr):\n        self.b = arr                # store an array in the actor's state\n    def get_u(self):\n        return self.u\n    def localSolve(self):\n        self.u = np.linalg.solve(self.a,self.b)\n\nworker = ArrayStorage.remote(n)\nworker.store_b.remote(b)\nworker.localSolve.remote()\nu = ray.get(worker.get_u.remote())\nprint(\"The solution is\", u)\n\n\nBack to the Poisson solver\nIn the parallel code, we’ll be storing u1 and u2 permanently on two workers. On each interval, we will be updating the left and right ghost values from the other processor via remote functions getLastValue and getFirstValue – otherwise the code is functionally identical to the serial version. Let’s store this code in poissonDual.py:\n##### this is poissonDual.py #####\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\nn, relativeTolerance = 20_000_000, 1e-4\nn1 = n//2; n2 = n - n1\nh = 1/(n-1)\n\nray.init(num_cpus=2, configure_logging=False)\n\nb = np.ones(n)*2*h*h\n\n@ray.remote\nclass ArrayStorage:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.b = None         # persistent variable\n        self.u = np.zeros(n)  # persistent variable\n    def store_b(self, arr):   # store an array in the actor's state\n        self.b = arr\n    def get_u(self):\n        return self.u\n    def localSolve(self, n, ghostValue, side):\n        self.u[1:n-1] = (self.u[0:n-2] + self.u[2:n] - self.b[1:n-1]) / 2\n        if side == 1: self.u[n-1] = (self.u[n-2] + ghostValue - self.b[n-1]) / 2\n        if side == 2: self.u[0] = (ghostValue + self.u[1] - self.b[0]) / 2\n    def getLastValue(self):\n        return self.u[-1]\n    def getFirstValue(self):\n        return self.u[0]\n\nworker1 = ArrayStorage.remote(n1)\nworker2 = ArrayStorage.remote(n2)\n\nworker1.store_b.remote(b[0:n1])\nworker2.store_b.remote(b[n1:n])\n\ndiff = 999.0   # difference between two successive values of u1[-1]\ncount = 0\nstart = time()\nwhile abs(diff) &gt; relativeTolerance:\n    count += 1\n    ghostLeft = ray.get(worker1.getLastValue.remote()) if count &gt; 1 else 0.0\n    ghostRight = ray.get(worker2.getFirstValue.remote()) if count &gt; 1 else 0.0\n    diff = ghostLeft\n    worker1.localSolve.remote(n1, ghostRight, 1)   # compute new u1\n    worker2.localSolve.remote(n2, ghostLeft,  2)   # compute new u2\n    newLeft = ray.get(worker1.getLastValue.remote())\n    diff = (diff-newLeft) / newLeft\n    if count%100 == 0:\n        u1 = ray.get(worker1.get_u.remote())\n        u2 = ray.get(worker2.get_u.remote())\n        print(u1[-3:], u2[:3], diff)\n\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(\"Converged after\", count, \"iterations\", \"with diff =\", diff)\nu1 = ray.get(worker1.get_u.remote())\nu2 = ray.get(worker2.get_u.remote())\nprint(\"Solution:\", u1[-3:], u2[:3])\nTime in seconds: 184.577\nConverged after 9961 iterations with diff = -9.999348935138563e-05\nSolution: [-2.50966143e-11 -2.50990843e-11 -2.51015743e-11] [-2.51015743e-11 -2.50990843e-11 -2.50966143e-11]\n\n\nScalable version\nLet’s adapt this code to any number of partitions.

While its web dashboard offers a user-friendly interface and can be convenient at times, it often involves too many clicks to complete routine tasks such as creating and configuring a virtual machine. The command-line interface (CLI) offers a faster, more streamlined way to create and manage resources. In this webinar, we will discuss python-openstackclient, walk through its setup and authentication, and demonstrate how to efficiently perform common OpenStack operations from the terminal. Whether you are managing a few instances or automating workflows, this session will help you leverage the CLI for speed, simplicity, and productivity."

    "text": "Launch an instance in 5 easy steps\n\nStep 1 - authenticate\nOur goal is to replace OpenStack web UI operations (lots of mouse clicks) with bash commands. We still need to log in to the web UI to authenticate our CLI client:\n\nLog into Cedar Cloud or old Arbutus\nIn the left-side drop-down menu, select your project  \nIn the right-side drop-down menu, click “Download OpenStack RC File”\n\nbash script with all env variables to access your OpenStack project through the command-line tools\nRC = Run Commands\n\nSource your OpenStack RC File\n\ncd ~/training/openstack\nsource ~/env-openstack/bin/activate\nmv ~/Downloads/CCInternal-*-openrc.sh .\nsource CCInternal-*-openrc.sh   # at prompt enter your CCDB password\n\n\nStep 2 - decide on VM flavour and image\nIn OpenStack, VM flavours define the hardware configurations for virtual machines, specifying vCPUs, RAM, and disk size. There are two types of flavours in our cloud:\n\nCompute (‘c’) flavours\n\nintended to run for a limited time, usually with a very high sustained CPU/memory usage\ne.g. for code development (need to compile often), or building a container image\n\nPersistent (‘p’) flavours\n\nintended to run indefinitely, with low or bursty CPU/memory requirements\ne.g. for hosting a web server, a data portal, or a web application\n\n\nLet’s check the resources available on this system:\nopenstack flavor list    # check VM flavours 🡒 use c2-15gb-31\nopenstack image list     # check OS images 🡒 use Ubuntu-24.04.2-Noble-x64-2025-03\nopenstack flavor show c2-15gb-31 --column disk --column ram   # get more info on this flavour\nFinally, in our cloud setup, each project should have its own dedicated network. This is not something you normally select, but you need to know the value to spin the instance, so let’s find it out:\nopenstack network list   # list visible (to us) networks 🡒 use CCInternal-SFU-training-network\n\n\nValues in this demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud\nFlavour\nImage\nNetwork\n\n\n\n\nCedar\nc2-15gb-31\nUbuntu-24.04.2-Noble-x64-2025-03\nCCInternal-SFU-training-network\n\n\nArbutus\np1-1.5gb\nUbuntu-24.04-Noble-x64-2024-06\nCCInternal-WG-Supp-network\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 - create an SSH key pair, upload the public key\nNext, we should create an ssh key pair and upload the public key (do it only once!):\ncd ~/.ssh\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f cedarKey       # enter a non-empty passphrase (strongly recommended)\nssh-add --apple-use-keychain cedarKey   # store the passphrase in the keychain (MacOS)\n\nopenstack keypair list                  # list currently uploaded keys\nopenstack keypair delete &lt;key&gt;          # if needed\nopenstack keypair create --public-key cedarKey.pub cedarKey   # upload the key\nopenstack keypair list                  # see the newly uploaded key\n\nUsing SSH keys in Linux\nGenerating SSH keys in Windows\n\n\n\nStep 4 - launch the VM instance\nNow it is time to launch our virtual machine:\nopenstack server create --flavor c2-15gb-31 --image Ubuntu-24.04.2-Noble-x64-2025-03 \\\n          --nic net-id=CCInternal-SFU-training-network --key-name cedarKey \\\n          --security-group default alexDemoBox   # launch the VM\n\nopenstack server list                            # should see our VM in the list\n\n\nStep 5 - associate a floating IP\nNext, we need to get a floating IP on an external-facing network and attach it to our VM:\nopenstack floating ip create Public-Network          # see \"floating_ip_address\"\nopenstack server add floating ip alexDemoBox &lt;floating_ip_address&gt;   # attach it to my instance\nNow our machine is ready for use!\nOptionally, you can display a few items:\nopenstack server show alexDemoBox                      # long table of all attributes\nopenstack server show alexDemoBox --column image       # check the VM's operating system\nopenstack server show alexDemoBox --column addresses   # check the VM's floating IP"

However, its performance often lags behind traditional compiled languages like C, C++, and Fortran, as well as newer contenders like Julia and Chapel. This course is designed to help you speed up your Python workflows using a variety of tools and techniques.\nWe’ll begin with classic optimization methods such as NumPy-based vectorization, and explore just-in-time compilation using Numba, along with performance profiling techniques. From there, we’ll delve into parallelization – starting with multithreading using external libraries like NumExpr and Python 3.13’s new free-threading capabilities – but placing greater emphasis on multiprocessing.\nNext, we’ll dive into Ray, a powerful and flexible framework for scaling Python applications. While Ray is widely used in AI, our focus will be on its core capabilities for distributed computing and data processing. You’ll learn how to parallelize CPU-bound numerical workflows – with and without reduction – as well as optimize I/O-bound tasks. We’ll also explore combining Ray with Numba and will discuss coding tightly coupled parallel problems.\nPlease note: this course does not cover GPU computing (which merits its own course), nor will we dive into mpi4py, the standard MPI library for Python."

    "section": "Slow series",
    "text": "Slow series\nWhen I teach parallel computing in other languages (Julia, Chapel), the approach is to take a numerical problem and parallelize it using multiple processors, and concentrate on various issues and bottlenecks (variable locks, load balancing, false sharing, messaging overheads, etc.) that lead to less than 100% parallel efficiency. For the numerical problem I usually select something that is very simple to code, yet forces the machine to do brute-force calculation that cannot be easily optimized.\nOne such problem is a slow series. It is a well-known fact that the harmonic series \\(\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\infty{1\\over k}\\) diverges. It turns out that if we omit the terms whose denominators in decimal notation contain any digit or string of digits, it converges, albeit very slowly (Schmelzer & Baillie 2008), e.g.\n\nBut this slow convergence is actually good for us: our answer will be bounded by the exact result (22.9206766192…) on the upper side, and we will force the computer to do CPU-intensive work. We will sum all the terms whose denominators do not contain the digit “9”, and evaluate the first \\(10^8\\) terms.\nI implemented and timed this problem running in serial in Julia (356ms) and Chapel (300ms) – both are compiled languages. Here is one possible Python implementation:\nfrom time import time\ndef slow(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = slow(100_000_000)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nLet’s save this code inside the file slowSeries.py and run it. Depending on the power supplied to my laptop’s CPU (which I find varies quite a bit depending on the environment), I get the average runtime of 6.625 seconds. That’s ~20X slower than in Julia and Chapel!\nNote that for other problems you will likely see an even bigger (100-200X) gap between Python and the compiled languages. In other languages looking for a substring in a decimal representation of a number takes a while, and there you will want to code this calculation using integer numbers. If we also do this via integer operations in Python:\ndef digitsin(num: int):\n    base = 10\n    while 9//base &gt; 0: base *= 10\n    while num &gt; 0:\n        if num%base == 9: return True\n        num = num//10\n    return False\n\ndef slow(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        if not digitsin(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\nour code will be ~3-4X slower, so we will use the first version of the code with if not \"9\" in str(i) – it turns out that in this particular case Python’s high-level substring search is actually quite well optimized!\n\n\n\n\nLooking at other problems, you will see that Python’s performance is worse on “tightly coupled” calculations on fundamental data types (integers, doubles), e.g. when you try to run the same arithmetic calculation on many elements of an array which is often the case in numerical simulation.\nOn the other hand, Python performs much better (or “less worse” compared to other languages) when doing file I/O and text processing. In addition, if your Python code spends most of its time in a compiled numerical library (often written in C or C++, and more recently in languages like Rust), your overall performance might be not that bad.\nWe will come back to the slow-series problem, but let’s first take a look at speeding up Python with NumPy."

    "text": "NumPy vectorization\nPython is dynamically typed, i.e. variables can change their type on the fly:\na = 5\na = 'apple'\nprint(a)\nThis makes Python very flexible. Out of these variables you can form 1D lists, and these can be inhomogeneous and can change values and types on the fly:\na = [1, 2, 'Vancouver', ['Earth', 'Moon'], {'list': 'an ordered collection of values'}]\na[1] = 'Sun'\na\nPython lists are very general and flexible, which is great for high-level programming, but it comes at a cost. The Python interpreter can’t make any assumptions about what will come next in a list, so it treats everything as a generic object with its own type and size. As lists get longer, eventually performance takes a hit.\nPython does not have any mechanism for a uniform/homogeneous list, where – to jump to element #1000 – you just take the memory address of the very first element and then increment it by (element size in bytes) x 999. NumPy library fills this gap by adding the concept of homogenous collections to python – numpy.ndarrays – which are multidimensional, homogeneous arrays of fixed-size items (most commonly numbers).\n\nThis brings large performance benefits!\n\n\nno reading of extra bits (type, size, reference count)\nno type checking\ncontiguous allocation in memory\nNumPy was written in C  ⇒  pre-compiled\n\n\nNumPy lets you work with mathematical arrays.\n\nLists and NumPy arrays behave very differently:\na = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nb = [5, 6, 7, 8]\na + b              # this will concatenate two lists: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\nimport numpy as np\nna = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\nnb = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])\nna + nb            # this will sum two vectors element-wise: array([6,8,10,12])\nna * nb            # element-wise product\n\nVectorized functions on array elements\nOne of the big reasons for using NumPy is so you can do fast numerical operations on a large number of elements. The result is another ndarray. In many calculations you can use replace the usual for/while loops with functions on NumPy elements.\na = np.arange(100)\na**2          # each element is a square of the corresponding element of a\nnp.log10(a+1)     # apply this operation to each element\n(a**2+a)/(a+1)    # the result should effectively be a floating-version copy of a\nnp.arange(10) / np.arange(1,11)  # this is np.array([ 0/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ..., 9/10 ])\n\n\nArray broadcasting\nAn extremely useful feature of vectorized functions is their ability to operate between arrays of different sizes and shapes, a set of operations known as broadcasting.\na = np.array([0, 1, 2])    # 1D array\nb = np.ones((3,3))         # 2D array\na + b          # `a` is stretched/broadcast across the 2nd dimension before addition;\n               # effectively we add `a` to each row of `b`\nIn the following example both arrays are broadcast from 1D to 2D to match the shape of the other:\na = np.arange(3)                     # 1D row;                a.shape is (3,)\nb = np.arange(3).reshape((3,1))      # effectively 1D column; b.shape is (3, 1)\na + b                                # the result is a 2D array!\nNumPy’s broadcast rules are:\n\nthe shape of an array with fewer dimensions is padded with 1’s on the left\nany array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other array’s shape\nif in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised\n\nFirst example above:\n********************\na: (3,)   -&gt;  (1,3)  -&gt;  (3,3)\nb: (3,3)  -&gt;  (3,3)  -&gt;  (3,3)\n                                -&gt;  (3,3)\nSecond example above:\n*********************\na: (3,)  -&gt;  (1,3)  -&gt;  (3,3)\nb: (3,1) -&gt;  (3,1)  -&gt;  (3,3)\n                                -&gt;  (3,3)\nExample 3:\n**********\na: (2,3)  -&gt;  (2,3)  -&gt;  (2,3)\nb: (3,)   -&gt;  (1,3)  -&gt;  (2,3)\n                                -&gt;  (2,3)\nExample 4:\n**********\na: (3,2)  -&gt;  (3,2)  -&gt;  (3,2)\nb: (3,)   -&gt;  (1,3)  -&gt;  (3,3)\n                                -&gt;  error\n\"ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,2) (3,)\"\nLet’s see how these rules work on a real-life problem!\n\n\nConverting velocity components\nConsider a spherical dataset describing Earth’s mantle convection, defined on a spherical grid \\(n_{lat}\\times\nn_{lon}\\times n_r = 500\\times 800\\times 300\\), with the total of \\(120\\times10^6\\) grid points. For each grid point, we need to convert from the spherical (lateral - longitudinal - radial) velocity components to their Cartesian equivalents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIf short on memory\n\n\n\nTo run all code fragments in this example at full \\(500\\times 800\\times 300\\) resolution, you will need to increase your memory ask to ~12000M, or otherwise your Python session will be killed mid-way. Alternatively, you can reduce the problem size by 4X (yielding much less impressive runtime difference) and continue running with 3600M memory:\nnlat, nlon = nlat//2, nlon//2   # 30e6 grid points\n\n\nLet’s initialize our problem:\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lpmv\nimport time\n\nnlat, nlon, nr = 500, 800, 300   # 120e6 grid points\nnlat, nlon = nlat//2, nlon//2    # 30e6 grid points\n\nlatitude = np.linspace(-90, 90, nlat)\nlongitude = np.linspace(0, 360, nlon)\nradius = np.linspace(3485, 6371, nr)\n\n# spherical velocity components: use Legendre Polynomials to set values\nvlat = lpmv(0,3,latitude/90).reshape(nlat,1,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nr).reshape(nr,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nlon)\nvlon = np.linspace(0,0,nlat).reshape(nlat,1,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nr).reshape(nr,1) + lpmv(0,2,longitude/180-1.)\nvrad = np.linspace(0,0,nlat).reshape(nlat,1,1) + lpmv(0,3,(radius-4928)/1443).reshape(nr,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nlon)\n\n# Cartesian velocity components\nvx = np.zeros((nlat,nr,nlon))\nvy = np.zeros((nlat,nr,nlon))\nvz = np.zeros((nlat,nr,nlon))\nWe need to go through all grid points, and at each point perform a matrix-vector multiplication. Here is our first attempt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might want to use Python’s tqdm library to provide a progress bar for real-time runtime estimate.\n\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nstart = time.time()\nfor i in tqdm(range(nlat)):\n    for k in range(nlon):\n        for j in range(nr):\n            vx[i,j,k] = - np.sin(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlon[i,j,k] - \\\n                np.sin(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.cos(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlat[i,j,k] + \\\n                np.cos(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.cos(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vy[i,j,k] = np.cos(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlon[i,j,k] - \\\n                np.sin(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.sin(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlat[i,j,k] + \\\n                np.cos(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.sin(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vz[i,j,k] = np.cos(np.radians(latitude[i]))*vlat[i,j,k] + \\\n                np.sin(np.radians(latitude[i]))*vrad[i,j,k]\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nOn my laptop this calculation took 1280s.

Getting rid of these redundancies:\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nstart = time.time()\nfor i in tqdm(range(nlat)):\n    lat = np.radians(latitude[i])\n    sinlat = np.sin(lat)\n    coslat = np.cos(lat)\n    for k in range(nlon):\n        lon = np.radians(longitude[k])\n        sinlon = np.sin(lon)\n        coslon = np.cos(lon)\n        for j in range(nr):\n            vx[i,j,k] = - sinlon*vlon[i,j,k] - sinlat*coslon*vlat[i,j,k] + coslat*coslon*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vy[i,j,k] = coslon*vlon[i,j,k] - sinlat*sinlon*vlat[i,j,k] + coslat*sinlon*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vz[i,j,k] = coslat*vlat[i,j,k] + sinlat*vrad[i,j,k]\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nbrings the runtime down to 192s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 1\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes using NumPy’s matrix-vector multiplication function np.dot speed this calculation? In this workflow, at each latitude-longitude you would define a rotation matrix and at each point a spherical velocity vector to compute their dot product, i.e. you would replace this fragment:\n        for j in range(nr):\n            vx[i,j,k] = - sinlon*vlon[i,j,k] - sinlat*coslon*vlat[i,j,k] + coslat*coslon*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vy[i,j,k] = coslon*vlon[i,j,k] - sinlat*sinlon*vlat[i,j,k] + coslat*sinlon*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vz[i,j,k] = coslat*vlat[i,j,k] + sinlat*vrad[i,j,k]\nwith this one:\n        rot = np.array([[-sinlon, -sinlat*coslon, coslat*coslon],\n                        [coslon, -sinlat*sinlon, coslat*sinlon],\n                        [0, coslat, sinlat]])\n        for j in range(nr):\n            vspherical = np.array([vlon[i,j,k], vlat[i,j,k], vrad[i,j,k]])\n            vx[i,j,k], vy[i,j,k], vz[i,j,k] = np.dot(rot, vspherical)\n\n\n\n\nTo speed up our computation, we should vectorize over one of the dimensions, e.g. longitudes:\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nstart = time.time()\nlon = np.radians(longitude[0:nlon])\nsinlon = np.sin(lon)\ncoslon = np.cos(lon)\nfor i in tqdm(range(nlat)):\n    lat = np.radians(latitude[i])\n    sinlat = np.sin(lat)\n    coslat = np.cos(lat)\n    for j in range(nr):\n        vx[i,j,0:nlon] = - sinlon*vlon[i,j,0:nlon] - sinlat*coslon*vlat[i,j,0:nlon] + coslat*coslon*vrad[i,j,0:nlon]\n        vy[i,j,0:nlon] = coslon*vlon[i,j,0:nlon] - sinlat*sinlon*vlat[i,j,0:nlon] + coslat*sinlon*vrad[i,j,0:nlon]\n        vz[i,j,0:nlon] = coslat*vlat[i,j,0:nlon] + sinlat*vrad[i,j,0:nlon]\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nLet’s see how broadcasting works in here. Consider the dimensions of all variables in the expression for computing vx[i,j,0:nlon]:\n[1,1,nlon] = - [nlon]*[1,1,nlon] - [1]*[nlon]*[1,1,nlon] + [1]*[nlon]*[1,1,nlon]\nOmitting scalars ([1]), padding with 1’s on the left will produce:\n[1,1,nlon] = - [1,1,nlon]*[1,1,nlon] - [1,1,nlon]*[1,1,nlon] + [1,1,nlon]*[1,1,nlon]\nNow all variables have the same dimensions, and all operations will be element-wise. The calculation time is now 3.503s, which is a huge improvement!\nVectorizing over two dimensions, e.g. over radii and longitudes leaves us with a single loop:\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nstart = time.time()\nlon = np.radians(longitude[0:nlon])\nsinlon = np.sin(lon)\ncoslon = np.cos(lon)\nfor i in tqdm(range(nlat)):\n    lat = np.radians(latitude[i])\n    sinlat = np.sin(lat)\n    coslat = np.cos(lat)\n    vx[i,0:nr,0:nlon] = - sinlon*vlon[i,0:nr,0:nlon] - sinlat*coslon*vlat[i,0:nr,0:nlon] + coslat*coslon*vrad[i,0:nr,0:nlon]\n    vy[i,0:nr,0:nlon] = coslon*vlon[i,0:nr,0:nlon] - sinlat*sinlon*vlat[i,0:nr,0:nlon] + coslat*sinlon*vrad[i,0:nr,0:nlon]\n    vz[i,0:nr,0:nlon] = coslat*vlat[i,0:nr,0:nlon] + sinlat*vrad[i,0:nr,0:nlon]\n\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nLet’s check broadcasting, taking the expression for computing vx[i,0:nr,0:nlon] and omitting scalars ([1]):\n[1,nr,nlon] = - [nlon]*[1,nr,nlon] - [1]*[nlon]*[1,nr,nlon] + [1]*[nlon]*[1,nr,nlon]          # original dimensions\n[1,nr,nlon] = - [1,1,nlon]*[1,nr,nlon] - [1,1,nlon]*[1,nr,nlon] + [1,1,nlon]*[1,nr,nlon]      # after padding with 1's on the left\n[1,nr,nlon] = - [1,nr,nlon]*[1,nr,nlon] - [1,nr,nlon]*[1,nr,nlon] + [1,nr,nlon]*[1,nr,nlon]   # after stretching 1's\nNow all variables have the same dimensions, and all operations will be element-wise. The calculation time goes down to 1.487s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMore vectorization != always faster\n\n\n\nYou can also vectorize in all three dimensions (latitudes, radii and longitudes), resulting in no explicit Python loops in your calculation at all, but this requires a little bit of extra work, and the computation time will actually slightly go up – any idea why?\n\n\nIn the end, with NumPy’s element-wise vectorized operations, we improved our time from 1280s to 1.5s! The entire calculation was done as a batch in a compiled C code, instead of cycling through individual elements and then calling a compiled C code on each. There are a lot fewer Python code lines to interpret and run.\n\n\nBack to the slow series\nLet’s use NumPy for our slow series calculation. We will:\n\nwrite a function that acts on each integer \\(k\\) in the series,\nconvert this function to a vectorized function that takes in an array of integer numbers and returns an array of summation terms,\nsum these terms to get the result.\n\nLet’s save the following code as slow2.py:\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\nn = 100_000_000\ndef combined(k):\n    if \"9\" not in str(k):\n        return 1.0/k\n    else:\n        return 0.0\n\nv3 = np.vectorize(combined)\nstart = time()\ni = np.arange(1,n+1)\ntotal = np.sum(v3(i))\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis particular code uses a lot of memory, but you have 2 options:\n\nrestart the job with --mem-per-cpu=14400 request (and single core) – probably not a good idea in a shared environment\nreduce n by 10X and then scale the time estimate by 10X – easy and will give a rough estimate, but the summation time does not scale exactly linearly with the number of terms (larger numbers have a higher probability of having 9’s in them)\nbreak one large numpy array into pieces, as shown in the code below\n\n\n\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\nn = 100_000_000\ndef combined(k):\n    if \"9\" not in str(k):\n        return 1.0/k\n    else:\n        return 0.0\n\nsize = n//10   # 10 pieces: 1-10e6, 10,000,001-20e6, ..., 90,000,001-100e6\nintervals = [(i*size+1,(i+1)*size) for i in range(10)]\nif n &gt; intervals[-1][1]:\n    intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], n)\n\nv3 = np.vectorize(combined)\nstart = time()\ntotal = 0\nfor span in intervals:\n    i = np.arange(span[0],span[1]+1)\n    total += np.sum(v3(i))\n\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nThe vectorized function is supposed to speed up calculating the terms, but our time becomes significantly worse (14.72s) than the original calculation (6.625s). The reason: we are no longer replacing multiple Python lines with a single line. The code inside combined() is still native Python code that is being interpreted on the fly, and we applying all its lines to each element of array i.\nThe function np.vectorize does not compile combined() – it simply adapts it to work with arrays, but underneath you are still running Python loops. If, instead, our vectorization could produce a compiled function that takes an array of integers and computes the slow series sum all inside the same C/C++/Fortran/Rust function, it would run ~20X faster than the original calculation. This is what a JIT compiler can do – we will study it later.\nAs it turns out, to speed up this problem with NumPy, you really need to perform the check for digit “9” via low-level custom NumPy code with a combination of vectorizable integer and floating operations, and this is very difficult – but not impossible – to implement."

    "text": "Parallelization\nWe can only start parallelizing the code when we are certain that our serial performance is not too bad, or at the very least we have optimized our serial Python code as much as possible. At this point, we don’t know if we have the best optimized Python code, as we are only starting to look into various tools that (hopefully) could speed up our code. We know that our code is ~20X slower than a compiled code in Julia/Chapel/C/Fortran, but do we have the best-performing Python code?\nNext we’ll try to speed up our code with NumExpr expression evaluator, in which simple mathematical / NumPy expressions can be parsed and then evaluated using compiled C code. NumExpr has an added benefit in that you can do this evaluation with multiple threads in parallel. But first we should talk about threads and processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThreads vs processes\nIn Unix a process is the smallest independent unit of processing, with its own memory space – think of an instance of a running application. The operating system tries its best to isolate processes so that a problem with one process doesn’t corrupt or cause havoc with another process. Context switching between processes is relatively expensive.\nA process can contain multiple threads, each running on its own CPU core (parallel execution), or sharing CPU cores if there are too few CPU cores relative to the number of threads (parallel + concurrent execution). All threads in a Unix process share the virtual memory address space of that process, e.g. several threads can update the same variable, whether it is safe to do so or not (we’ll talk about thread-safe programming in this course). Context switching between threads of the same process is less expensive.\n \n\nThreads within a process communicate via shared memory, so multi-threading is always limited to shared memory within one node.\nProcesses communicate via messages (over the cluster interconnect or via shared memory). Multi-processing can be in shared memory (one node, multiple CPU cores) or distributed memory (multiple cluster nodes). With multi-processing there is no scaling limitation, but traditionally it has been more difficult to write code for distributed-memory systems. Various libraries tries to simplify it with high-level abstractions.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhat are the benefits of each type of parallelism: multi-threading vs. multi-processing? Consider: 1. context switching, e.g. starting and terminating or concurrent execution on the same CPU core, 1. communication, 1. scaling up."

    "title": "Part 1: towards high-performance Python",
    "section": "Multithreading",
    "text": "Multithreading\nPython uses reference counting for memory management. Each object in memory that you create in Python has a counter storing the number of references to that object. Once this counter reaches zero (when you delete objects), Python releases memory occupied by the object. If you have multiple threads, letting them modify the same counter at the same time can lead to a race condition where you can write an incorrect value to the counter, leading to either memory leaks (too much memory allocated) or to releasing memory incorrectly when a there is still a reference to that object on another thread.\nOne way to solve this problem is to have locks on all shared data structures, where only one thread at a time can modify data. This can also lead to problems, and Python’s solution prior to version 3.13 is to use a lock on the interpreter itself (Global Interpreter Lock = GIL), so that only one thread can run at a time. Recall that in Python each line of code is being interpreted on the fly, so placing a lock on the interpreter means pausing code execution while some other thread is running.\n\nInstalling free-threaded Python\nStarting with v3.13, you can install Python with the GIL removed. This mode called free threading is still considered experimental and is usually not enabled by default. There is a good Real Python article (might require subscription) describing various build options to enable free threading including enabling experimental JIT. Here is a simple setup on my laptop:\nuv venv ~/env-free --python 3.14t   # create a new virtual environment\nsource ~/env-free/bin/activate\n...\ndeactivate\nAt the time of this writing, there is no free-threaded Python module on the clusters. Therefore, on the training cluster I used uv to install free-threaded Python 3.14t into a world-readable subdirectory in /project/def-sponsor00/shared:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nuv is currently not supported on our clusters so use it with caution.\n\n\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # install uv\n# make sure ~/.local/bin is in your path (the location of `uv` binary)\n\nuv venv /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-free --python 3.14t   # create a new virtual environment\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-free/bin/activate\n...\nwhich python             # /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-free/bin/python\nls -l $(which python) n  # symbolic link to ~user01/.local/share/uv/python/...\ndeactivate\n\ncountfiles /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-free   # 15 files\ncountfiles ~/.local/share/uv/python                 # 5,508 files\n\n\nRunning free-threaded Python\nPython has several multithreading modules/libraries in its Standard Library. For example, threading library provides a function Thread() to launch new threads. Here, instead, I will use concurrent library for launching threads and threading library for printing thread IDs:\nimport concurrent.futures as ft\nimport threading as t\n\nt.current_thread().name   # 'MainThread'\n\ndef worker(x):\n    print(t.current_thread().name)\n\nwith ft.ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:\n    results = pool.map(worker, range(30))   # in the output 'ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1\":\n                                            # 0 is the pool number\n                                            # 1 is the thread number\nIn this simple code above we’ll see output mostly from threads 0, 1, maybe 2, as they are not very busy.\nHere is a full example of the slow series calculation (store it as sum.py) with native multithreading:\n\nfrom time import time\nimport argparse\nimport concurrent.futures as ft\nimport threading as t\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument('--n', default=100_000_000, type=int, help='number of terms')\nparser.add_argument('--nthreads', default=1, type=int, help='number of tasks')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nn, nthreads = args.n, args.nthreads\n\ndef slow(interval):\n    print(t.current_thread().name)\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(interval[0], interval[1]+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\n\nsize = n//nthreads   # size of each batch\nintervals = [(i*size+1,(i+1)*size) for i in range(nthreads)]\nif n &gt; intervals[-1][1]: intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], n)   # add the remainder, if any\n\nprint(\"running with\", args.nthreads, \"threads over\", intervals)\nstart = time()\nwith ft.ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:\n    results = pool.map(slow, intervals)\n\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(\"sum =\", sum(r for r in results))\nIf you run this code with v3.12 or earlier, you will get about the same runtime independently of the number of threads, as – due to the GIL – these threads will be taking turns running. With a free-threaded Python 3.14 build, you will see better runtimes with additional threads, provided you have the CPU cores to run all threads in parallel:\ncd ~/tmp\nsource /project/def-sponsor00/shared/env-free/bin/activate\nsalloc --cpus-per-task=4 --time=0:60:0 --mem-per-cpu=3600\npython sum.py\npython sum.py --nthreads=2\npython sum.py --nthreads=4\npython sum.py --nthreads=8   # do we get further 2X speedup?\nrunning with 1 threads over [(1, 100000000)]\nTime in seconds: 7.331\nsum = 13.277605949858103\nrunning with 2 threads over [(1, 50000000), (50000001, 100000000)]\nTime in seconds: 3.801\nsum = 13.277605949855722\nrunning with 4 threads over [(1, 25000000), (25000001, 50000000),\n                              (50000001, 75000000), (75000001, 100000000)]\nTime in seconds: 2.977\nsum = 13.277605949854326\nNote that the free-threaded build has some additional overhead when executing Python code compared to the default GIL-enabled build. In 3.13, this overhead is ~40%, in 3.14 seems to be somewhat smaller.\n\n\nNumExpr with regular Python\nAlternatively, you can do multithreading in Python via 3rd-party libraries that were written in other languages in which there is no GIL. One such famous library is NumExpr which is essentially a compiler for NumPy operations. It takes its input NumPy expression as a string and can run it with multiple threads.\n\nsupported operators: - + - * / % &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &lt; &lt;= == != &gt;= &gt; & | ~ **\nsupported functions: where, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos arctan, arctan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, arcsinh, arccosh arctanh, log, log10, log1p, exp, expm1, sqrt, abs, conj, real, imag, complex, contains\nsupported reductions: sum, product\nsupported data types: 8-bit boolean, 32-bit signed integer (int or int32), 64-bit signed integer (long or int64), 32-bit single-precision floating point number (float or float32), 64-bit double-precision floating point number (double or float64), 2x64-bit double-precision complex number (complex or complex128), raw string of bytes\n\nHere is a very simple NumPy example, timing only the calculation itself:\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np\n\nn = 100_000_000\na = np.random.rand(n)\n\nstart = time()\nb = np.sin(2*np.pi*a)**2 + np.cos(2*np.pi*a)**2\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(a,b)\nI get the average runtime of 2.04s. Here is how you would implement this with NumExpr:\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np, numexpr as ne\n\nn = 100_000_000\na = np.random.rand(n)\n\nprev = ne.set_num_threads(1)   # specify the number of threads, returns the previous setting\nprint(prev)                    # on first use tries to grab all cores\nstart = time()\ntwoPi = 2*np.pi\nb = ne.evaluate('sin(twoPi*a)**2 + cos(twoPi*a)**2')\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(a,b)\nAverage time:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n1.738\n0.898\n0.478\n0.305\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would we implement the slow series with NumExpr? We need a mechanism to check if a substring is present in a string:\nimport numpy as np, numexpr as ne\nx = np.array([b'hi', b'there'])   # an array of byte strings (stored as an array of ASCII codes)\nx.dtype     # each element is a 5-element string\nx.nbytes    # 10 bytes in total, i.e. 1 byte per ASCII character\nne.evaluate(\"contains(x, b'hi')\")   # returns array([True, False])\nne.evaluate(\"contains(x, b'h')\")    # returns array([True, True])\nne.evaluate(\"~contains(x, b'h')\")   # not contains =&gt; returns array([False, False])\nWe can use NumExpr to parallelize checking for substrings (store this as slow3.py):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionHigh memory usage\n\n\n\nThis code will use more than 3600M memory. Use --cpus-per-task=4 --mem-per-cpu=3600 giving you the total memory of 14,400MB shared between the 4 cores, especially that we’ll need several cores now for multithreading.\n\n\nfrom time import time\nimport numpy as np, numexpr as ne\nn = 100_000_000\nne.set_num_threads(1)     # set the number of threads\nstart = time()\ni = np.arange(1,n+1)      # array of integers\nj = i.astype(np.bytes_)   # convert to byte strings\nmask = ne.evaluate(\"~contains(j, '9')\")   # parallel part; returns an array of True/False\nnonZeroTerms = i[mask]\ninverse = np.vectorize(lambda x: 1.0/x)\ntotal = sum(inverse(nonZeroTerms))\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nHere are the average (over three runs) times:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n18.427\n17.375\n17.029\n\n\n\nClearly, we are bottlenecked by the serial part of the code. Let’s use another NumExpr call to evaluate 1.0/x – store this as updated slow4.py:\n&lt; inverse = np.vectorize(lambda x: 1.0/x)\n&lt; total = sum(inverse(nonZeroTerms))\n---\n&gt; total = np.sum(ne.evaluate(\"1.0/nonZeroTerms\"))\nHere are the improved times:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n12.094\n11.304\n10.965\n10.83\n\n\n\nObviously, we still have some bottlenecks: look at the scaling, and recall the original serial runtime 6.625s on which we are trying to improve. How do we find these? Let’s use a profiler!"

There are several good open-source profilers for Python codes, e.g. cProfile, line_profiler, Scalene, Pyinstrument, Linux’s perf profiler, and few others.\n\n\n\nIn our last code we had a sequential workflow with multiple lines, so let’s measure its performance line by line using Scalene profiler.

I have not found a way to do this quickly and elegantly in NumExpr (very marginal improvement with j = i.astype(dtype='S9')), but perhaps there is a solution?\nI will leave it as a take-home exercise, and please let me know if you find a solution!"

    "section": "Multiprocessing",
    "text": "Multiprocessing\n\nWith multiprocessing you can launch multiple processes and run each process on a separate CPU core. Each process will have its own interpreter with its own GIL and memory space, and – unlike with multithreading – they can all run at the same time in parallel.\nPython has the multiprocessing module as part of its Standard Library. Unfortunately, it has some limitations: (1) it only accepts certain Python functions, and (2) it cannot handle a lot of different types of Python objects. This is due to the way Python serializes (packs) data and sends it to the other processes.\nFortunately, there is a fork of the multiprocessing module called multiprocess (https://pypi.org/project/multiprocess) that solves most of these problems by using a different serialization mechanism. The way you use it is identical to multiprocessing, so it should be straightforward to convert your code between the two.\nConsider Python’s serial map() function:\nhelp(map)\nr = map(lambda x: x**2, [1,2,3])\nlist(r)\nWe can write a Python function to sleep for 1 second, and run it 10 times with serial map():\nimport time\nstart = time.time()\nr = list(map(lambda x: time.sleep(1), range(10)))   # use 0, 1, ..., 9 as arguments to the lambda function\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nThis takes 10.045s as expected.\nAt this point we need to restart our job on 4 cores:\nsalloc --time=2:00:0 --ntasks=4 --mem-per-cpu=3600\nLet’s parallelize it with multiprocess, creating a pool of workers and replacing serial map() with parallel pool.map():\n\nNote: serial map() returns an iterable, whereas parallel pool.map() already returns a list  ⇒  no need to convert it to a list.\n\nimport time\nfrom multiprocess import Pool\nncores = 4            # set it to the actual number of cores\nprint(\"Running on\", ncores, \"cores\")\npool = Pool(ncores)   # create a pool of workers\nstart = time.time()\nr = pool.map(lambda x: time.sleep(1), range(10))   # use 0, 1, ..., 9 as arguments to the lambda function\npool.close()          # turn off your parallel workers\nend = time.time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\n\n\n\n\nOn 4 cores this takes 3.005 seconds: running batches of 4 + 4 + 2 calls, i.e. in the 1st second we run four sleep(1) calls in parallel, in the 2nd second we run another set of four sleep(1) calls, and the remaining two calls run during the 3rd second.\nOn 8 cores this takes 2.007 seconds: running batches of 8+2 calls.\nOn 1 core it takes 10.013 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are not doing real calculations here, just waiting for 1 wallclock time second in each call. If you attempt to run multiple processes (e.g. ncores = 4 in the code above) on 1 physical core, they will take turns running at the same time, but they will compare their time against the wallclock time (not CPU time), and all of them will finish running as if you had 4 physical cores.\n\n\nHow do we parallelize the slow series with parallel map()? One idea is to create a function to process each of the \\(10^8\\) terms and use map() to apply it to each term. Here is the serial version of this code:\nfrom time import time\nn = 100_000_000\ndef combined(k):\n    if \"9\" in str(k):\n        return 0.0\n    else:\n        return 1.0/k\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = sum(map(combined, range(1,n+1)))   # use 1,...,n as arguments to `combined` function\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nThis takes 9.403 seconds.\nWith multiprocess we would be inclined to use sum(pool.map(combined, range(1,n+1)))). Unfortunately, pool.map() returns a list, and with \\(10^8\\) input integers it will return a \\(10^8\\)-element list, processing and summing which will take a long time … (85 seconds in my tests). Simply put, lists perform poorly in Python.\nHow do we speed it up?\nIdea: Break down the problem into ncores partial sums, and do it each of them on a separate core.\nHint: Here is how this approach would work on two cores (not the full code):\ndef partial(interval):\n    return sum(map(combined, range(interval[0],interval[1]+1)))\n\npool = Pool(2)\ntotal = pool.map(partial, [(1, n//2-1), (n//2,n)])\nprint(sum(total))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 2\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete and run this code on two cores. Add timing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a scalable version of this code and run it on an arbitrary number of cores (up to the maximum number of cores you can use). Use the following strategy to divide the workload:\nncores = ...\npool = Pool(ncores)\nsize = n // ncores\nintervals = [(i*size+1,(i+1)*size) for i in range(ncores)]\nif n &gt; intervals[-1][1]:\n    intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is what I get for timing on my laptop and on the training cluster:\n\n\n\nncores\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nlaptop wallclock runtime (sec)\n8.294\n4.324\n2.200\n1.408\n\n\n--ntasks=4 cluster runtime (sec)\n17.557\n8.780\n4.499\n4.508\n\n\n\nOur parallel scaling looks great, but in terms of absolute numbers we are still lagging behind the same problem implemented with a serial code in compiled languages …"

    "section": "Numba JIT compiler",
    "text": "Numba JIT compiler\n\n\nHopefully, I have convinced you that – in order to get decent performance out of your Python code – you need to compile it with a proper compiler (and not just NumExpr). There are several Python compilers worth mentioning here:\n\nWe have already looked at NumExpr (only takes simple expressions).\nNumba open-source just-in-time compiler that uses LLVM underneath, can also parallelize your code for multi-core CPUs and GPUs; often requires only minor code changes.\nCython open-source compiled language is a superset of Python: Python-like code with Cython-specific extensions for C types.\nCodon is research project from MIT: not endorsing it, but it consistently comes up high in my search results, source code https://github.com/exaloop/codon and the related article https://bit.ly/3uUvTmd.\nNew proprietary programming language https://www.modular.com/max/mojo is a superset of Python, with somewhat misleading (68,000X) speedup claims on their front page, documentation/examples/workshops at https://github.com/modularml/mojo.\n\n\n\nHere we’ll take a look at Numba: - compiles selected blocks of Python code to machine code, - can process multi-dimensional arrays, - can do multithreading on multiple CPU cores (and we’ll later learn how to use it with multiprocessing), - can use GPUs (not covered here): you’d be writing CUDA kernels.\nLet’s compute the following sum:\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos(i)}{i} = -\\ln\\left(2\\sin0.5\\right) \\]\nHere is the familiar serial implementation (let’s save it as trig.py):\nfrom time import time\nfrom math import cos, sin, log\n\ndef trig(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        total += cos(i)/i\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = trig(100_000_000)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(\"approximate / exact =\", -total/log(2*sin(0.5)))\nOur runtime is 7.493 seconds.\nLet’s add the following Python decorator just before our function definition:\nfrom numba import jit\n@jit(nopython=True)\n...\nThe first time you use Numba in a code, it might be slow, but all subsequent uses will be fast: needs time to compile the code. Our runtime went down to 0.693 seconds – that’s more than a 10X speedup!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn the training cluster I see ~5X speedup.\n\n\nThere are two compilation modes in Numba: 1. object mode: generates a more stable, slower code 1. nopython mode: generates much faster code that requires knowledge of all types, has limitations that can force Numba to fall back to the object mode; the flag nopython=True enforces faster mode and raises an error in case of problems\n\nParallelizing\nLet’s add parallel=True to our decorator and change range(1,n+1) to prange(1,n+1) - it’ll be subdividing loops into pieces to pass them to all available CPU cores via multithreading. On my 8-core laptop the runtime goes down to 0.341 seconds – a further ~2X improvement … This is not so impressive …\nIt turns out there is quite a bit of overhead with subdividing loops, starting/stopping threads and orchestrating everything. If instead of \\(10^8\\) we consider \\(10^{10}\\) terms, a single thread processes this in 57.890 seconds, whereas 8 threads take 10.125 seconds – factor of 5.7X speedup!\n\n\n\nBack to the slow series\nLet’s apply Numba to our slow series problem. Take the very first version of the code (6.625 seconds):\nfrom time import time\ndef slow(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        if not \"9\" in str(i):\n            total += 1.0 / i\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = slow(100_000_000)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nand add from numba import jit and @jit(nopython=True) to it. Turns out, when run in serial, our time improves only by ~10-20%. There is some compilation overhead, so for bigger problems you could gain few additional %.\nAs you can see, Numba is not a silver bullet when it comes to speeding up Python. It works great for many numerical problems including the trigonometric series above, but for problems with high-level Python abstractions – in our case the specific line if not \"9\" in str(i) – Numba does not perform very well.\n\n\nFast implementation\nIt turns out with Numba there is a way to make the slow series code almost as fast as with the compiled languages. Check out this implementation:\nfrom time import time\nfrom numba import jit\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef combined(k):\n    base, k0 = 10, k\n    while 9//base &gt; 0: base *= 10\n    while k &gt; 0:\n        if k%base == 9: return 0.0\n        k = k//10\n    return 1.0/k0\n\n@jit(nopython=True)\ndef slow(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        total += combined(i)\n    return total\n\nstart = time()\ntotal = slow(100_000_000)\nend = time()\nprint(\"Time in seconds:\", round(end-start,3))\nprint(total)\nIt finishes in 0.601 seconds, i.e. ~10X faster than the first Numba implementation – any ideas why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 4\n\n\n\n\n\nParallelize this code with multiple threads and time it on several cores – does your time improve? (it should somewhat) Let’s fill this table together:\nncores           1      2      4\nwallclock runtime (sec)\n\n\n\nIn Part 2 we will combine Numba with multiprocessing via Ray tasks – this approach can scale beyond a single node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWe covered a lot of material in this section! Let’s summarize the most important points. Which tool would you use, in what situation, and why?\n- which of today’s tools let you do multithreading?\n- which of today’s tools let you do multiprocessing?\n- which Python compilers did we try?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 6\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich tool would you use for your research problem and why? Are you ready to parallelize your workflow?"

Unlike a GUI, the shell is a text-based interface to the operating system that excels at two things:\n\nlaunching other tools and scripts, and\nconnecting standard input/output of these tools through pipes to form more complex commands.\n\nThe shell design follows the classic UNIX philosophy of breaking complex projects into simpler subtasks and chaining together components and utilities. The name “shell” comes from the coconut anallogy, as it is a shell around the operating system kernel, surrounded itself by utilities and applications. Shell commands are often very cryptic, and this is by design to avoid too much typing.\nWe use the Unix shell because it is very powerful, great for automation and for creating reproducible workflows, and is necessary to work on larger Unix systems. Bash is one of many Unix shell implementations out there. It is a default on the Alliance systems, but you can easily switch to a different shell such as tcsh, zsh, etc. The main difference between these is a slight change in the command syntax.\nFor the hands-on work, we have set up a small training cluster sfuschool.c3.ca that features the same software setup as our real production clusters. In our “Introduction to HPC” course we teach the specifics of working on a cluster: its software environment, scheduler, compilers, parallel programming models, and so on.

    "text": "Transferring files interactively with sftp\nscp is useful, but what if we don’t know the exact location of what we want to transfer? Or perhaps we’re simply not sure which files we want to transfer yet. sftp is an interactive way of downloading and uploading files. Let’s connect to a cluster with sftp:\n[local]$ sftp userXX@sfuschool.c3.ca\nThis will start what appears to be a shell with the prompt sftp&gt;. However, we only have access to a limited number of commands. We can see which commands are available with help:\nsftp&gt; help\nAvailable commands:\nbye                                Quit sftp\ncd path                            Change remote directory to 'path'\nchgrp grp path                     Change group of file 'path' to 'grp'\nchmod mode path                    Change permissions of file 'path' to 'mode'\nchown own path                     Change owner of file 'path' to 'own'\ndf [-hi] [path]                    Display statistics for current directory or\n                                   filesystem containing 'path'\nexit                               Quit sftp\nget [-afPpRr] remote [local]       Download file\nreget [-fPpRr] remote [local]      Resume download file\nreput [-fPpRr] [local] remote      Resume upload file\nhelp                               Display this help text\nlcd path                           Change local directory to 'path'\nlls [ls-options [path]]            Display local directory listing\nlmkdir path                        Create local directory\nln [-s] oldpath newpath            Link remote file (-s for symlink)\nlpwd                               Print local working directory\nls [-1afhlnrSt] [path]             Display remote directory listing\n...\nNotice the presence of multiple commands that make mention of local and remote. We are actually browsing two filesystems at once, with two working directories!\nsftp&gt; pwd    # show our remote working directory\nsftp&gt; lpwd   # show our local working directory\nsftp&gt; ls     # show the contents of our remote directory\nsftp&gt; lls    # show the contents of our local directory\nsftp&gt; cd     # change the remote directory\nsftp&gt; lcd    # change the local directory\nsftp&gt; put localFile    # upload a file\nsftp&gt; get remoteFile   # download a file\nAnd we can recursively put/get files by just adding -r. Note that the directory needs to be present beforehand:\nsftp&gt; mkdir content\nsftp&gt; put -r content/\nTo quit, type exit or bye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExercise\n\n\n\nUsing one of the above methods, try transferring files to and from the cluster. For example, you can download bfiles.tar.gz to your laptop. Which method do you like best?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote on Windows line endings\n\n\n\n\nWhen you transfer files to from a Windows system to a Unix system (Mac, Linux, BSD, Solaris, etc.) this can cause problems. Windows encodes its files slightly different than Unix, and adds an extra character to every line. On a Unix system, every line in a file ends with a \\n (newline), whereas on Windows every line in a file ends with a \\r\\n (carriage return + newline). This causes problems sometimes.\nIn some bash implementations, you can identify if a file with Windows line endings with cat -A   filename. A file with Windows line endings will have ^M$ at the end of every line. A file with Unix line endings will have $ at the end of a line.\nThough most modern programming languages and software handle this correctly, in some rare instances you may run into an issue. The solution is to convert a file from Windows to Unix encoding with the command dos2unix filename. Conversely, to convert back to Windows format, you can run unix2dos filename.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote on syncing\n\n\n\nThere also a command rsync for synching two directories. It is super useful, especially for work in progress. For example, you can use it the download all the latest PNG images from your working directory on the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion scp and sftp\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy a file to/from the training cluster using either scp or sftp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion rsync\n\n\n\n\n\nBring up the manual page on rsync, then use it to synchronize a directory from the training cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion Multiple files\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a command to scp multiple files with a single command so that scp asks you for password (and possible MFA) only once for all files, not once per file. Feel free to google this problem. If you have an Alliance account, try copying a set of files from the training cluster to Cedar (you will run into a problem):\nfor i in {1..5}; do\n    echo ${RANDOM}${RANDOM}${RANDOM} &gt; a$i.txt\ndone\nscp a*.txt username@cedar.alliancecan.ca:scratch\nHow many times does it ask for a password?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion ssh config file\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s discuss remote system profiles in ~/.ssh/config. Consider this:\nHost &lt;name&gt;\n    HostName sfuschool.c3.ca\n    User userXX\n\nNote that in Windows you can create .ssh/config in C:\\Users\\username. If referencing this folder from Windows Subsystem for Linux, make sure to run chmod 600 ~\\.ssh\\* after creating the config file.\nAnother useful setting is IdentityFile private_ssh_key coupled with IdentitiesOnly yes (i.e. use only the provided key).",

    "text": "Functions\nFunctions are similar to scripts, but there are some differences. A bash script is an executable file sitting at a given path. A bash function is defined in your environment. Therefore, when running a script, you need to prepend its path to its name, whereas a function – once defined in your environment – can be called by its name without a need for a path. Both scripts and functions can take command-line arguments.\nA convenient place to put all your function definitions is ~/.bashrc file which is run every time you start a new shell (local or remote).\nLike in any programming language, in bash a function is a block of code that you can access by its name. The syntax is:\nfunctionName() {\n  command 1\n  command 2\n  ...\n}\nInside functions you can access its arguments with variables $1 $2 … $# $@ – exactly the same as in scripts. Functions are very convenient because you can define them inside your ~/.bashrc file. Alternatively, you can place them into a file and then source them whenever needed:\n$ source allMyFunctions.sh\nHere is our first function:\ngreetings() {\n  echo hello\n}\nLet’s write a function ‘combine()’ that takes all the files we pass to it, copies them into a randomly-named directory and prints that directory to the screen:\ncombine() {\n  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"No arguments specified.

Since it was originally designed for sequential write/read on magnetic tapes, it does not index data for random access to its contents. A number of 3rd-party tools can add indexing to tar. However, there is a modern version of tar called DAR (stands for Disk ARchiver) that has some nice features:\n\neach DAR archive includes an index for fast file list/restore,\nDAR supports full / differential / incremental backup,\nDAR has build-in compression on a file-by-file basis to make it more resilient against data corruption and to avoid compressing already compressed files such as video,\nDAR supports strong encryption,\nDAR can detect corruption in both headers and saved data and recover with minimal data loss,\n\nand so on.

Just-in-time compilation, among other things, makes Julia really fast yet interactive. For heavy computations, Julia supports multi-threaded and multi-process parallelism, both natively and via a number of external packages. It also supports memory arrays distributed across multiple processes either on the same or different nodes. In this hands-on workshop, we will start with Julia’s multi-threading features and then focus on Distributed multi-processing standard library and its large array of tools. We will demo parallelization using two problems: a slowly converging series and a Julia set. We will run examples on a multi-core laptop and an HPC cluster.\nInstructor: Alex Razoumov (SFU)\nPrerequisites: Ideally, some familiarity with the Alliance’s HPC cluster environment, in particular, with the Slurm scheduler. Having some previous serial Julia programming experience would help, but we will start slowly so you will be able to follow up even if you are new to Julia.\nSoftware: There are a couple of options:\n\nYou can run Julia on our training cluster, in which case you will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer. On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed – try typing ssh in a terminal to make sure it is there. Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by default –- try opening PowerShell and typing ssh to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend installing the free Home Edition of MobaXterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html. We will provide guest accounts on our training cluster, and you would not need to install Julia on your computer in this setup.\nYou can run Julia on your own computer, in which case you can install it from https://julialang.org/downloads – this may take a while so please do this before the class.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Julia webinars\nSince 2020, we’ve been teaching occasional webinars on parallel programming in Julia – watch the recordings here.\n\n\nExternal links\n\nThink Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist by Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey is a very thorough introduction to non-parallel Julia for beginners\nJulia at Scale forum\nBaolai Ge’s (SHARCNET) November 2020 webinar Julia: Parallel computing revisited\nJulia performance tips\nHow to optimise Julia code: A practical guide\nA Deep Introduction to JIT Compilers",

Out of these variables you can form 1D lists, and these can be inhomogeneous and can change values and types on the fly:\nPython lists are very general and flexible, which is great for high-level programming, but it comes at a cost. The Python interpreter can’t make any assumptions about what will come next in a list, so it treats everything as a generic object with its own type and size. As lists get longer, eventually performance takes a hit.\nPython does not have any mechanism for a uniform/homogeneous list, where – to jump to element #1000 – you just take the memory address of the very first element and then increment it by (element size in bytes) x 999. NumPy library fills this gap by adding the concept of homogenous collections to python – numpy.ndarrays – which are multidimensional, homogeneous arrays of fixed-size items (most commonly numbers).\nLists and NumPy arrays behave very differently:",

Consider the following (inefficient) Python code that converts the spherical velocity components to the Cartesian velocity components on a \\(500\\times 300\\times 800\\) spherical grid:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lpmv\nimport time\n\nnlat, nr, nlon = 500, 300, 800   # 120e6 grid points\n\nlatitude = np.linspace(-90, 90, nlat)\nradius = np.linspace(3485, 6371, nr)\nlongitude = np.linspace(0, 360, nlon)\n\n# spherical velocity components: use Legendre Polynomials to set values\nvlat = lpmv(0,3,latitude/90).reshape(nlat,1,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nr).reshape(nr,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nlon)\nvrad = np.linspace(0,0,nlat).reshape(nlat,1,1) + lpmv(0,3,(radius-4928)/1443).reshape(nr,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nlon)\nvlon = np.linspace(0,0,nlat).reshape(nlat,1,1) + np.linspace(0,0,nr).reshape(nr,1) + lpmv(0,2,longitude/180-1.)\n\n# Cartesian velocity components\nvx = np.zeros((nlat,nr,nlon))\nvy = np.zeros((nlat,nr,nlon))\nvz = np.zeros((nlat,nr,nlon))\n\nstart = time.time()\nfor i in range(nlat):\n    for j in range(nr):\n        for k in range(nlon):\n            vx[i,j,k] = - np.sin(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlon[i,j,k] \\\n              - np.sin(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.cos(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlat[i,j,k] \\\n              + np.cos(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.cos(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vy[i,j,k] = np.cos(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlon[i,j,k] \\\n              - np.sin(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.sin(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vlat[i,j,k] \\\n              + np.cos(np.radians(latitude[i]))*np.sin(np.radians(longitude[k]))*vrad[i,j,k]\n            vz[i,j,k] = np.cos(np.radians(latitude[i]))*vlat[i,j,k] \\\n              + np.sin(np.radians(latitude[i]))*vrad[i,j,k]\nfinish = time.time()\nprint(\"It took\", finish - start, \"seconds\")\nUsing NumPy further, you can speed up the nested loop between the start = ... and finish = ... lines by at least a factor of 1,000X. If you achieve a significant speedup, please send us your solution at “training at westdri dot ca”.\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate functions\nAggregate functions take an ndarray and reduce it along one (or more) axes. E.g., in 1D:\na = np.linspace(1, 2, 100)\na.mean()     # arithmetic mean\na.max()      # maximum value\na.argmax()   # index of the maximum value\na.sum()      # sum of all values\na.prod()     # product of all values\nOr in 2D:\nb = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.sum()\n300\nb.sum(axis=0)   # add rows\nb.sum(axis=1)   # add columns\n\n\nBoolean indexing\na = np.linspace(1, 2, 100)\na &lt; 1.5       # array of True and/or False\na[a &lt; 1.5]    # will only return those elements that meet True condition\na[a &lt; 1.5].shape   # there are exactly 50 such elements\na.shape\nAn interesting question comes up: what will happen if we apply a mask to a multi-dimensional array? How will it show incomplete rows/columns that have both True and False masks?\nb = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)   # 2D array\nb &gt; 22      # all rows are False, except for the last row [F,F,F,T,T]\nb[b &gt; 22]   # turns out we always get a 1D array with only True elements",

Python’s standard library includes many functions we worked with before (print, int, round, …) and is included with Python. There are many other additional modules in the standard library such as math:\nYou can also import math’s items directly:\nYou can also create an alias from the library:",

Consider the following script input.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    print(line, end='')\nIn the terminal make it executable (chmod u+x input.py), and then use it to receive any standard input:\n./input.py                          # repeat each line you type until Ctrl-C\necho one two three | ./input.py     # print back the line\nls -l | ./input.py                  # list all files\ncat input.py | ./input.py           # print itself from standard input\ntail -1 input.py | ./input.py       # print its own last line\nLet’s add support for Unix standard input to read.py. Delete print('\\n', f[26:-4].capitalize()) and change the last two lines in read.py from:\nfor f in filenames:\n    process(f, action)\nto:\nif len(filenames) == 0:\n    process(sys.stdin,action)       # process standard input\nelse:\n    for f in filenames:             # same as before\n        print('\\n', f[26:-4].capitalize())\n        process(f,action)\nNow sys.stdin acts as if it was the name of a file containing whatever was passed as standard input.\n$ python read.py --mean data-python/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv\n$ python read.py --mean &lt; data-python/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv    # anyone knows why this could be useful?\nWhy would you want to support standard input? Answer: you can do preprocessing in bash before passing the data to your Python script, e.g.\n$ head -5 data-python/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv | python read.py --mean    # process only first five countries\ncp data-python/gapminder_gdp_asia.csv a1\ncat data-python/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv | sed '1d' &gt;&gt; a1   # add all European data without the header\ncat a1 | python read.py --mean          # merge Asian and European data and calculate joint statistics\nHere is our full script:\nimport sys\nimport pandas as pd\naction = sys.argv[1]\nassert action in ['--min', '--mean', '--max'], 'action must be one of: --min --mean --max'\nfilenames = sys.argv[2:]\ndef process(filename, action):\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col='country')\n    if 'continent' in data.columns.tolist():   # if 'continent' column exists\n        data = data.drop('continent',1)        #     delete it (1 stands for column, 0 for row)\n    if action == '--min':\n        values = data.min().tolist()\n    elif action == '--mean':\n        values = data.mean().tolist()\n    elif action == '--max':\n        values = data.max().tolist()\n    print(values,'\\n')\nif len(filenames) == 0:\n    process(sys.stdin,action)       # process standard input\nelse:\n    for f in filenames:             # same as before\n        print('\\n', f[26:-4].capitalize())\n        process(f,action)",
