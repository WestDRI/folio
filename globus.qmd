**Thursday, October 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025**

<!-- You can find this page at &nbsp; -->
<!-- <span style="font-size:1.8em;">https://folio.vastcloud.org/globus</span> -->

**Abstract**: Globus is a widely used platform for secure, reliable, and high-performance data transfer across
research systems. While the web interface is intuitive and remains our primary recommendation for most users,
the command-line interface (CLI) offers advanced capabilities for automation, scripting, and managing
large-scale workflows. In this webinar, we will present the globus-cli tool, show how to authenticate and
configure your environment, and demonstrate key commands for transferring, monitoring, and managing files
between endpoints. You will also learn tips for integrating globus-cli into scripts for repeatable and
efficient data movement.






## Advantages of Globus transfer over traditional `scp`/`sftp`/`rsync`

In April, we hosted a webinar ["Introduction to Globus"](https://training.westdri.ca/tools/rdm). Here is a
quick recap of why you might choose Globus over traditional file transfer tools:

1. **Parallel, multi-stream transfers**: Globus automatically uses multiple TCP streams, tuning them for
   wide-area networks, which can dramatically outperform single-threaded `scp` or `sftp` &nbsp;⮕&nbsp; great
   for large-scale (multi-GB and multi-PB) datasets where `scp`/`sftp` typically fail or crawl. In short,
   Globus will try to maximize the bandwidth between any two endpoints.
1. If a transfer is interrupted (network drop, machine reboot, etc), Globus **resumes where it left off
   without user intervention**.
1. Automatic **checksum verification**.
1. File **transfer happens in the background**, i.e. you can close your laptop and the transfer continues
   server-to-server, unlike with `scp`/`sftp` where the session must stay open.
   - you'll get an email notification when a task completes or fails
1. Provides logs, progress tracking, notifications, and retry logic automatically.
   - many research institutions use Globus for secure, auditable data movement that meets funding agency or
     privacy requirements
1. You can **share data** with collaborators who don't have direct system accounts.

By default, Globus uses a Web-based interface to manage transfers via a web browser. However, this requires a
lot of mouse clicking and sometimes navigating very large directory trees.

<!-- There is also [Globus SDK for Python](https://globus-sdk-python.readthedocs.io) -- not covered in this presentation. -->

There is also a [REST-style Application Programming Interface (API)](https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer)
that supports submitting and monitoring file transfers and managing Globus Connect Personal collections. This
could be used in scripting languages like Python and Ruby to integrate Globus into web portals. This is not
covered in this presentation.

In this webinar we will focus on using Globus from the command line to automate your transfers with shell
commands and scripts/functions.

::: {.callout-caution}
## Caution
Files aren't stored on Globus -- they reside on the underlying filesystem. If you don't intend to remove files
from your directories, avoid deleting them through the Globus interface.
:::






## Install Globus CLI tools

### On your computer

```sh
uv venv ~/env-globus --python 3.12   # create a new virtual environment
source ~/env-globus/bin/activate
uv pip install globus-cli
...
deactivate
```

### On a cluster

```sh
nibi
module avail python                # several versions available
module load python/3.12.4
python -m venv ~/env-globus        # install Python tools in your $HOME/env-globus
source ~/env-globus/bin/activate   # load the environment
python -m pip install --upgrade pip --no-index
python -m pip install --no-index globus_cli setuptools   # all these will go into your $HOME/env-globus
...
deactivate
```






## Getting help

<!-- Quality-of-life settings -->

```sh
source ~/env-globus/bin/activate
eval "$(globus --bash-completer)"   # enable tab completion in bash version 4.4 or newer
globus --help             # or -h
globus <command> --help   # or -h
globus ls --help
globus --help
globus list-commands
```







## Starting up and authenticating

In Globus there are two levels of authentication.

(1) First, you need to log in to Globus itself:

<!-- my primary identity is razoumov@computecanada.ca - it's not an email address -->

```sh
globus login   # log in to a Globus session through your browser
globus whoami --verbose
globus session show   # show all active sessions
# globus logout   # might run this at some point if you no longer need Globus
```

(2) Second, when you access an endpoint (e.g. `globus ls ...`, `globus transfer ...`) inside a session, you
will need to give permission to Globus to access that endpoint / filesystem on your behalf. Theoretically,
these "consents" can be managed via https://auth.globus.org/consents (where you can see and revoke them
individually), but in practice I find it very difficult to find out which one is which endpoint (it does not
say!), so in practice the only way I can use this site is to remove all "consents".

Let's see how consents work in practice. We define a couple of Globus tutorial collections through their IDs:

```sh
export T1=6c54cade-bde5-45c1-bdea-f4bd71dba2cc
export T2=31ce9ba0-176d-45a5-add3-f37d233ba47d
globus ls $T1
```

If this is your first time accessing this collection, you will likely get "The collection you are trying to
access data on requires you to grant consent for the Globus CLI to access it"

```sh
globus session consent <authentication_scope>   # opens a browser page
globus ls $T1                      # empty
globus ls $T1:/home/share/godata   # three small files
```

<!-- missing consent scope ... -->

::: {.callout-note}
### From Globus manual
- When the Globus CLI is used to interact with a collection, it may find that it has not been granted
  sufficient permissions to access the collection. In these cases, the CLI will prompt you to run a login
  command to grant it the necessary consent.
- There are also other cases, such as strict authentication policies, in which the CLI dynamically discovers
  requirements which require a new login flow.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
### Infinite authentication loop
Sometimes you might get stuck in an infinite authentication loop. After having logged into Globus, when trying
to run `globus ls ...` or `globus transfer ...`, if you are missing that endpoint's consent, Globus **should
tell you** to run a very specific command `globus session consent <authentication_scope>`. Sometimes, if some
Globus machinery behind the scenes is not updated properly, you might get instead:
```
The resource you are trying to access requires you to re-authenticate with specific identities.
message: Missing required data_access consent
Please use "globus session update" to re-authenticate with specific identities
```
If you follow this advice, you will get stuck in an infinite authentication loop. In my experience, waiting
for a day or so should automatically resolve the problem. Alternatively, email us at
globus@tech.alliancecan.ca to open a support ticket.
:::





## Other synchronous (blocking) commands

::: {.callout-note}
`globus ls` works on directories, not files. `globus transfer` works with both directories and files, but
there are some syntax limitations -- we will see these later.
:::

`globus ls "$COLLECTION"` is an example of a synchronous Globus command that waits for the completion of the
task before exiting. Other synchronous command examples are:

```sh
globus mkdir "$COLLECTION:existing_path/new_dir_name"   # create a new directory
globus rename "$COLLECTION" "old_dir_name" "new_dir_name"
globus rename "$COLLECTION" "old_file_name" "new_file_name"
globus rename "$COLLECTION" "old_path/old_file_name" "new_path/new_file_name" # can move files across directories
globus rm "$COLLECTION:existing_path --recursive
```

::: {.callout-note}
`globus delete` is a non-blocking version of `globus rm`, with all the same flags.
:::






## Single file transfer

### All inside the tutorial endpoint

**Note**: with `globus transfer` for a single file, it is very important to specify the full file path in the
destination that includes the file name, not just the target directory. Without the file name, the transfer
will eventually fail, after trying for 1 hour.

```sh
globus ls $T1    # empty
globus ls $T1:/home/share/godata   # file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
globus mkdir $T1:test
globus transfer $T1:/home/share/godata/file1.txt $T1:test/file1.txt
```

This command is non-blocking, i.e. it will exit back to the command prompt, while transfer will take place in
the background. Note that you will receive an email when transfer is complete. If you want to block until
transfer completion in the terminal, run:

```sh
globus task wait <taskID_from_the_previous_line>
globus ls -l $T1:test

globus rm -r $T1:test
globus task wait <taskID_from_the_previous_line>
```

### Transfer a tutorial collection file to Fir

```sh
globus endpoint search alliance
globus endpoint search alliance | grep fir   # use the ID of alliancecan#fir-globus in the next line

export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
globus ls $FIR   # might or might not have access

globus session consent 'urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all[*https://auth.globus.org/scopes/8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3/data_access]'   # select razoumov@computecanada.ca

globus ls $FIR   # should see my Fir home directory
globus ls $FIR:scratch
globus transfer $T1:/home/share/godata/file1.txt $FIR:scratch/f1.txt
globus task wait <taskID_from_the_previous_line>
globus task show <taskID_from_the_previous_line>
globus task show <taskID_from_the_previous_line> | grep -E 'Status|Faults'

globus task list --filter-status ACTIVE   # show all my active tasks
globus task show <taskID>
```

<!-- globus endpoint show $FIR -->
<!-- globus endpoint show $T1 -->

### Transfer a large (8.1GB) file from Fir to Nibi

```sh
globus endpoint search alliance | grep nibi
export NIBI=07baf15f-d7fd-4b6a-bf8a-5b5ef2e229d3
export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
globus transfer $FIR:projects/def-razoumov-ac/razoumov/ieeevis2017-clouds/2d_lonlat_20.nc $NIBI:scratch/2d_lonlat_20.nc
```

This command will fail if one or more endpoints require authentication. Fortunately, in this case you will be
prompted to run the following command:

```sh
globus session consent <authentication_scope>   # in browser; select razoumov@computecanada.ca
```

Then you can rerun the transfer command:

```sh
globus transfer $FIR:projects/def-razoumov-ac/razoumov/ieeevis2017-clouds/2d_lonlat_20.nc $NIBI:scratch/2d_lonlat_20.nc
globus task show ba064a80-9e6d-11f0-9016-0affca67c55f | grep -E 'Status|Faults'
```






## Multiple files

Globus CLI does not support Unix shell wildmasks. However, you can achieve the same by copying a directory
with a `--include` flag, e.g. this will copy only `*.sh` files:

```sh
globus transfer --recursive --include '*.sh' --exclude '*' $FIR:syncHPC/testEGL/ $LAPTOP:tmp/
```

::: {.callout-note}
1. `--include` requires `--recursive`
1. in my tests, `--exclude '*'` is needed to make sure no other files are copied
1. you can specify many filters in a row, e.g. `--include '*.txt' --include '*.md'`
:::

Alternatively, you can use `--batch` to specify multiple files with their source and destination paths:

```txt
# store this as include.txt: a list of source paths followed by destination paths
alexWithUpdatedDriver.sh alexWithUpdatedDriver.sh
bartWithCorrection.sh bartWithCorrection.sh
test.sh test.sh   # Slurm scripting for testing
```

```sh
globus transfer $FIR:syncHPC/testEGL/ $LAPTOP:tmp/ --batch include.txt
```

With this approach, you can mix multiple paths in a single file, e.g.

```txt
alexWithUpdatedDriver.sh a/alexWithUpdatedDriver.sh
bartWithCorrection.sh b/bartWithCorrection.sh
test.sh test.sh   # Slurm scripting for testing
```

would create the subdirectories `a/` and `b/` inside `~/tmp/` as part of the transfer.

You can also delete files in batch:

```sh
globus delete "COLLECTION:path/" --batch delete.txt
```







## Globus Connect Personal

Globus Connect Personal (GCP) may be installed in order to turn a local machine into a Globus endpoint. This
way you can transfer files with Globus from/to your computer.

1. download Globus Connect Personal from https://app.globus.org/collections/gcp
1. install and run "Globus Connect Personal" application
1. click Log in, follow in the browser, create a name (I used "alexrsfu"), provide details, save, exit setup
1. in the menu bar click Globus Connect Personal | Preferences...  
    Access tab, specify directory access details  
    Info tab | write down your Endpoint ID <!-- = 441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5 -->
1. continue running Globus Connect Personal in the background

```sh
globus endpoint search alexrsfu
export LAPTOP=441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5

globus ls $LAPTOP:tmp       # my local files
ls ~/tmp                    # should be the same

globus ls -l $FIR:data/deepImpact
globus transfer $FIR:data/deepImpact/yB31_oneblock_46521.vti $LAPTOP:tmp/   # won't succeed (destination != filename)
globus task show <taskID> | grep -E 'Status|Faults'   # shows that it's ACTIVE but there are some Faults
globus task event-list --filter-errors <taskID>       # shows the actual error
globus task cancel <taskID>

globus transfer $FIR:data/deepImpact/yB31_oneblock_46521.vti $LAPTOP:tmp/46521.vti   # this one works great!
```

You can create endpoints for any number of personal computers. However, transfer between two personal
endpoints is not enabled by default. If you need this capability, please contact open a [Globs
ticket](mailto:globus@tech.alliancecan.ca) to set up a **Globus Plus account**.

### Transfer a large file from Fir to my laptop

```sh
export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
export LAPTOP=441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5
globus transfer $FIR:projects/def-razoumov-ac/razoumov/ieeevis2017-clouds/2d_lonlat_20.nc $LAPTOP:tmp/2d_lonlat_20.nc
globus task show cb3dba5e-578a-11f0-939f-0e285752bd6d | grep -E 'Status|Faults'
```







<!-- ## Troubleshooting -->

<!-- ```sh -->
<!-- globus task cancel f09b98dd-5778-11f0-8b04-02fa2a4031ab -->
<!-- globus transfer $T1:/home/share/godata/file1.txt $FIR:scratch/file1.txt   # restart -->
<!-- globus task list --filter-status ACTIVE -->
<!-- globus task show 44b6937d-5784-11f0-ad34-0affcfc1d1e5 | grep -E 'Status|Faults' -->
<!-- globus task event-list --filter-errors 44b6937d-5784-11f0-ad34-0affcfc1d1e5   # see error messages -->
<!-- ``` -->






## Capturing task ID

### Option 1: Capture at scheduling time

Let's copy a file from a Globus tutorial collection to Fir's `/scratch`:

```sh
export T1=6c54cade-bde5-45c1-bdea-f4bd71dba2cc
export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
taskid=$(globus transfer $T1:/home/share/godata/file1.txt $FIR:scratch/file1.txt | grep "Task ID" | awk '{print $3}')
globus task show $taskid | grep -E 'Status|Faults'
globus task wait $taskid
```

### Option 2: Use labels to filter current tasks

1. assign a label to a Globus task
1. filter all your Globus tasks by this label
1. extract the taskID and use it for getting details on the task

```sh
label="copying a Globus tutorial file"
label=$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM   # labels don't have to be unique, but having a unique label helps
globus transfer --label $label $T1:/home/share/godata/file1.txt $FIR:scratch/file1.txt
taskid=$(globus task list --filter-label $label | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
globus task show $taskid | grep -E 'Status|Faults'
globus task wait $taskid
```










## Automating workflows

Using one of these two approaches to handle task IDs, you can create a shell script to automate Globus
transfers. However, be aware that you may occasionally encounter authentication or other issues, so treat
these scripts as a convenience rather than a fully reliable black box.

Everyone's workflow is different, so there is no one-size-fits-all script for every purpose. Instead, here are
a few interactive functions that simplify my own day-to-day Globus workflows: `gcp()`, `gshow()`, `gwait()`,
`gerror()` and `gcancel()`.

The command `gcp`:

1. provides a `scp`-like syntax, where `source` and `dest` could be "fir", "nibi", "rorqual", "trillium", "laptop"
2. stores endpoint IDs (don't need to define these separately)
3. checks if the source and destination extensions are the same &nbsp;⮕&nbsp; forces you to enter a valid file
   name in the destination (providing just a directory will result in failed transfer)

```sh
function gcp() {
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "No arguments specified ... Usage: gcp source:/path/to/src/file.ext dest:/path/to/dest/file.ext"
	return 1
    fi
    SRC="${1%%:*}"    # endpoint name before the colon in the 1st argument
    DEST="${2%%:*}"   # endpoint name before the colon in the 2nd argument
    PATH1="${1#*:}"   # file path after the colon in the 1st argument
    PATH2="${2#*:}"   # file path after the colon in the 2nd argument
    echo $SRC $DEST
    rename() {
	SRC="${1//$3/$4}"
	DEST="${2//$3/$4}"
    }
    rename "$SRC" "$DEST" fir 8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
    rename "$SRC" "$DEST" nibi 07baf15f-d7fd-4b6a-bf8a-5b5ef2e229d3
    rename "$SRC" "$DEST" trillium ad462f99-8436-42b4-adc6-3644e36c1b67
    rename "$SRC" "$DEST" rorqual 93b2625f-a4ba-47ac-90d4-0bbb5ae19451
    rename "$SRC" "$DEST" laptop 441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5
    extension() {
	filename=$(basename "$1")
	if [[ "$filename" == *.* ]]; then
	    extension="${filename##*.}"
	else
	    extension=""
	fi
	echo "$extension"
    }
    EXT1=$(extension "$PATH1")
    EXT2=$(extension "$PATH2")
    if [[ "$EXT1" != "$EXT2" ]]; then
	echo "Extension mismatch ($EXT1 and $EXT2) ... exiting"
	return 1
    fi
    globus transfer $SRC:$PATH1 $DEST:$PATH2
}

function gshow() {
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "No arguments specified ... Usage: gv <taskID1> <taskID2> ..."
	echo "Therefore, showing all active tasks:"
	globus task list --filter-status ACTIVE
	return 1
    fi
    for task in $@; do
	globus task show $task | grep -E 'Status|Faults'
    done
}

function gwait() {
    globus task wait $1
}

function gerror() {
    globus task event-list --filter-errors $1
}

function gcancel() {
    globus task cancel $1
}
```

With these functions defined, the last two transfers can be written as:

```sh
DATA=projects/def-razoumov-ac/razoumov/ieeevis2017-clouds   # same data directory for both transfers
gcp fir:$DATA/2d_lonlat_20.nc nibi:scratch/2d_lonlat_20.nc
gcp fir:$DATA/2d_lonlat_20.nc laptop:tmp/2d_lonlat_20.nc
gshow                          # show all active tasks
gshow taskID1 taskID2          # show details of these tasks
gwait taskID1                  # block until taskID1 completes
```






## Syncing directories

Globus sync makes the destination match the source:

```sh
globus transfer --sync-level <level> sourceEndpointID:/path/to/source/ destEndpointID:/path/to/dest/
```

<level> is one of:
- exists → only send if destination file does not exist
- size → send if size differs
- mtime → send if modification time differs
- checksum → compute checksums and send if they differ (slowest)

::: {.callout-note}
`--recursive` will include subdirectories.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Globus sync doesn't delete extra files on the destination, i.e. there is no `rsync --delete` equivalent.
:::

Here is a complete example:

```sh
export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
export LAPTOP=441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5
mkdir ~/tmp   # no need to create ~/tmp/testEGL
globus transfer --sync-level size --recursive $FIR:syncHPC/testEGL/ $LAPTOP:tmp/testEGL/
```

To automate this, I would probably create a separate `gsync()` function.










## Running globus-cli on a cluster

Refer to an earlier section to install globus-cli in a virtual environment on a cluster.

```sh
source ~/env-globus/bin/activate   # load the environment

globus login    # log in by pasting the URL into a browser; copy the code back into the terminal
globus whoami   # returns razoumov@computecanada.ca

globus endpoint search alliance | grep -e fir -e nibi
export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
export NIBI=07baf15f-d7fd-4b6a-bf8a-5b5ef2e229d3
globus ls $FIR   # prompts to run the following command
globus session consent <authentication_scope>   # log in by pasting the URL into a browser; copy the code back
globus ls $FIR   # works now!

globus ls -l $FIR:projects/def-razoumov-ac/razoumov/ieeevis2017-clouds | grep 2d_lonlat_20.nc   # 8.03GB
globus transfer $FIR:projects/def-razoumov-ac/razoumov/ieeevis2017-clouds/2d_lonlat_20.nc $NIBI:scratch/2d_lonlat_20.nc
globus task show 95ca1d32-9ee8-11f0-afcf-0e1cc5cf4f03 | grep -E 'Status|Faults'
```

Interestingly, if you are running Globus Connect Personal on your machine which is behind the firewall, you
can still initialize transfer to/from your computer on the cluster, which will never work with
`scp`/`sftp`/`rsync`:

```sh
export LAPTOP=441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5
globus transfer $NIBI:scratch/2d_lonlat_20.nc $LAPTOP:tmp/2d_lonlat_20.nc
```








## Globus sharing

Globus sharing enables people to access files stored on your account on an Alliance cluster even if they don't
have an account on that system. You can find some Web interface-specific details in our documentation
<https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus#Globus_sharing>{target="_blank"}. You can share with individual
Globus users and with groups. Here we'll demo sharing with users.

::: {.callout-note}
### Your collaborator's Globus userID
You will need your collaborator's Globus userID to give them access. You can look it up yourself using their
Globus username, e.g.

```sh
globus get-identities razoumov@computecanada.ca
```

or you can ask them for it. They can look it up via the web interface:

1. log in to https://globus.alliancecan.ca
1. Settings | Account | select Identity from the list | click the ↓ arrow to see your ID

or in many different ways in the CLI:

```sh
globus get-identities <collaboratorUserName>
globus whoami --verbose | grep ID
globus session show
```

E.g., when I run these commands myself, all three return the same useID.
<!-- 32b4419f-e34a-433d-905d-61478c6cd7af -->
:::

To demo sharing, I will use my alternative Globus ID (log in via <https://www.globus.org> and organization =
Globus ID):

```sh
globus get-identities razoumov@globusid.org                  # userName ⟹ userID
globus get-identities ae739fc4-d274-11e5-b957-ab0e5eadc80e   # userID ⟹ userName

export COLLABORATOR=ae739fc4-d274-11e5-b957-ab0e5eadc80e  # could be user or group ID
export FIR=8dec4129-9ab4-451d-a45f-5b4b8471f7a3
```

::: {.callout-important}
### Guest collections inside GCP
Creating guest collections on a Globus Connect Personal mapped collection is supported, but it requires a paid
subscription. Without it, you cannot share files hosted on your own computer. See the details
[here](https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/gcp_management/#create_guest_collection). Alternatively, you can
host a guest collection on a Globus Connect Server mapped collection (subscription required), which is how we
have it set up on our clusters.
:::

You can share your files stored on an Alliance cluster with any Globus user in the world, even if that user
does not have an account on that cluster.

- `/home` -- yes on all general-purpose clusters (not sure on Trillium)
- `/scratch` -- yes on Beluga, Narval, Rorqual, no on other clusters
- `/project` -- on PI's request only (to prevent sharing other users' files)

Here we will create a guest collections on Fir's `/home` and then we'll share it with our collaborator.







::: {.callout-caution}
### Running this workflow on the cluster
As of this moment, the default version of globus-cli on our clusters is slightly old, so the command `globus
collection create ...` does not exist there. Therefore, you can either upgrade globus-cli in place yourself:

```sh
source ~/env-globus/bin/activate
globus version   # 3.2.0, latest is 3.38.0
globus update
```

or you can run this workflow on your own computer where presumably you have the latest version installed.
:::








On Fir, let's create `~/share` and place a file (e.g. `noise.silo`) there. In Globus, Fir is already
registered as a Globus Connect Server v5 Mapped Collection, so you can create a new guest collection inside
it:

```sh
globus collection create guest $FIR /home/razoumov/share project003   # create a new guest collection
```

At this point Globus might ask you to run `globus login --gcs ...` to verify who you are, and then you can
rerun the command:

```sh
globus collection create guest $FIR /home/razoumov/share project003   # create a new guest collection
# Display Name:                     project003
# Owner:                            razoumov@computecanada.ca
# ID:                               2342c760-b98b-40cc-b3f7-9550dce48c83
# Collection Type:                  guest
# ...
# Public:                           True
```






"Public" means that anyone with a Globus account can search for this collection with `globus endpoint search
project003`, but they cannot see the files inside it. For file access, give your collaborator permission (`r`
or `rw`) to access your collection, e.g. at its root level (that will point to `~/share`):

```sh
COLLECTION=2342c760-b98b-40cc-b3f7-9550dce48c83
globus endpoint permission create --identity $COLLABORATOR --permissions rw $COLLECTION:/
# Message: Access rule created successfully.
# Rule ID: 228e0e90-a07f-11f0-b159-0affca67c55f
```

If instead you want to share with all logged-in Globus users:

```sh
globus endpoint permission create --permissions r --all-authenticated $COLLECTION:/
```

If you want to share with anyone (no login needed):

```sh
globus endpoint permission create --permissions r --anonymous $COLLECTION:/
```


<!-- abc -->
<!-- --principal all_authenticated_users -->
<!-- Any logged-in Globus user -->
<!-- Works on all Guest Collections -->
<!-- --principal anonymous -->
<!-- Anyone with the link (no login) -->
<!-- Requires paid/subscribed mapped collection -->







::: {.callout-note}
Keep the permission's ruleID, as you will need it later to modify/revoke access.
:::

At this point your collaborator should be able to see the files inside your collection:

```sh
globus endpoint search project003   # if they have just the name => returns collectionID
globus ls 0a13e15f-4848-4b63-aa87-31202640eff4   # should see noise.silo
```

and transfer files (download with `r` and download/upload with `rw` permissions) with `globus transfer ...` or
via the web interface.

Since this is your own collection, you should be able to use it as well, e.g. -- after starting Globus Connect
Personal -- you can transfer files between this collection and your computer:

```sh
export LAPTOP=441e818f-5783-11f0-81e1-0affcfc1d1e5
globus transfer $COLLECTION:noise.silo $LAPTOP:tmp/n.silo   # download a file
date > ~/tmp/test.txt
globus transfer $LAPTOP:tmp/test.txt $COLLECTION:/test.txt   # upload a file
```

or, after adding "project003" to the `gcp()` shell function:

```sh
gcp project003:noise.silo laptop:tmp/n.silo    # download a file
gcp laptop:tmp/test.txt project003:/test.txt   # upload a file
```

After your project is done, you might want to remove permissions:

```sh
globus endpoint permission list $COLLECTION   # show all permissions for this collection with ruleIDs
globus endpoint permission delete $COLLECTION 228e0e90-a07f-11f0-b159-0affca67c55f   # collectionID ruleID
```

and eventually delete the guest collection:

```sh
globus collection delete $COLLECTION
```

::: {.callout-caution}
If you delete the collection before removing its permissions, the permissions will get orphaned, and you will
still see them listed (without ruleIDs) for any future collections created with the same shared directory -- I
don't know how to delete these permissions in this case. Therefore, make sure to delete any associated
permissions before deleting the collection.

## Globus flows

*Flow* is a series of steps that are performed in a specified order, e.g. you can run `tar`, delete files, add
some other processing before / after transfer, share files, etc. A flow definition is a JSON document.

- how to create a flow <https://docs.globus.org/guides/tutorials/flow-automation/create-a-flow>{target="_blank"}

```sh
cd ~/tmp
git clone https://github.com/globus/globus-flows-trigger-examples.git
globus flows create "My Transfer and Share Flow Example" transfer_share/definition.json --input-schema transfer_share/schema.json
```

- thir own example contains deprecated flow commands ... someone needs to update the script
- too advanced for this webinar
