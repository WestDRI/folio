<!-- Course materials will be added here shortly before the start of the course. -->

This is a hands-on introduction to the Linux command line and the interaction with a remote server. This
course mixes <a href="https://software-carpentry.org" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> materials with
our own custom training.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (SFU)

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no previous experience is required. We will provide
guest accounts to one of our Linux systems.

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in order
to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html){target="_blank"}. On Mac and
Linux computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
